"Title: Court ruling...?, Content: I went to court to battle an uncooperative ex-wife over unpaid medical bills for my son. The judge ordered her to pay me the FULL balance. The bills are in collections but it get's very confusing because they are my sons bills, but under my name. The judge said we can take care of it any way I want meaning she can send me the check or send it directly to the collections agency. I want it sent directly to me so I can make sure it gets paid, she hadn't paid this bill for over 2 years, why would I trust her? Now she says to me to give her copies of the bills so she can review them. Is she too late for this? It's already court ordered for her to pay it. I have already done enough leg work getting balances and calling and fighting with collection agencies because she wouldn't cooperate. Do i have to provide her anything now that its court ordered and been through court? She is threatening a De novo hearing., Answer: She is in contempt of court.  At this point, its not her concern what the bills are and for how much.  She doesn't need to see them.  The court ordered her to pay them and that's all she needs to know.  I'd advise the court that she is in default and request another hearing.",Politics & Government

"Title: How can you get out of the army?, Content: Before I met my wife (when she was 17) her Ex-Navy father got mad at her and drove her down to the army recruiting station and forced her to enlist. She was officially sworn in at MEPS the following march, the very day of her 18th birthday. We met a few days after she was sworn in. We married in July she is in Basic training now. She was so scared when she left, she is sacred now, she never wanted to go, she was just afraid to say no to her Dad. Her dream is to be a veterinarian, but her Dad got her signed up as an Infantry Supply clerk. Is there anyway to save her from this nightmare. Is there anyway to get her discarged?, Answer: She should stay in.  Basic will probably be the hardest thing she'll have to do.  After she gets out, she can go anywhere as a supply clerk.  Probably won't go to a combat area unless she requests it.\nSo she gets stationed somewhere states side.  It's like a 9-5 job most of the time.  She come in, do her job, and go home.  She'll get housing, so you can join her.\nIt'll pay for her school to be a veterinarian.  Hell, she can go to some night classes and get all the prerequisites outta the way before she gets out.\nHowever, if she really wants out and she is in basic...all she has to do is ask.  They will try to talk her out of it.  Probably bad mouth her.  Call her names.  Etc.  But they will give her a general discharge..or a less than honorable discharge I think they called it.\nWe had someone go awol while I was in basic and they just mailed him his less than honorable.  They don't want to spend too much money on someone and just have them leave.  They may sound tough on her...but they will let her leave if she wants.  Have her talk to the military pastor/preacher.  He can help her. \nOn that note...make sure she wants to and she's not just echoing what you want...this less than honorable discharge will follow her everywhere.",Politics & Government

"Title: Does somebody know about geometric point of view of billiard?, Content: recently I saw a cartoon about it geometric solutions of billiard game. it was a cartoon where Donald Duck was taught about presentation of mathematics in the life and he was given some geometric ways to play the game, e.g. directions to beat the ball and its formulas..., Answer: You're refering to ""Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land"", and as for the equations, I dunno.  But if you imagine hitting a ball straight on (with no english...no spin), then the natural angle (after hitting a second ball) will carry the ball off the tangent at the point the two balls made contact, while the second ball will travel at a right angle from the tangent.  In other words, picture in your mind you just just shot the cue ball at the 9 ball.  Got it in your head?  Now slow it down to the point where the two balls make contact and pause.  Now, if you don't know anything about tangent lines, I've got some info below.  Basically, a tangent line touches a circle (like the balls) in ONLY one point.  When the two balls hit, the first ball will travel along the tangent, while the second ball will always travel at a right angle.  Again, this is WITHOUT any spin, which will either increase or decrease the angle of the path of the balls.  That's one way you can control the balls and use them to your advantage, but you can start with learning the natural angles.  Practice...you'll get it.  Hope this helps :-P",Sports

This will help if you catch the same people in the act next time.\n\nAnother precaution you can take (besides locking up the car and house securely and/or with an alarm) is to engrave a code number on your stuff, and write down the code number on a separate piece of paper that you put in safe-keeping.  Then if you know who took the stuff, the police can check for the code number you provide them, and that will be enough evidence for them to reclaim the property and charge the criminals.\n\nGood luck!",Business & Finance

"Title: what is french kissing?Is it some where near the legs?why is it so different.?, Content: can men n women both do it., Answer: A French kiss is a romantic or sexual kiss in which one participant's tongue touches the other's tongue (or lips), and usually enters their mouth. Also known as a tongue Kiss, or Deep Kiss.\n\nWhile family members may sometimes kiss on the lips, a tongue kiss almost always indicates a romantic or sexual relationship. French kissing stimulates the lips, tongue and mouth, which are all areas very sensitive to touch. It is considered by many to be both very pleasurable and highly intimate. Unlike other forms of ""casual"" kissing (such as brief kisses of greeting or friendship), episodes of French kissing will often be prolonged, intense, and passionate. It may signal the beginning of a period of ""making out"" or sex. Because of the intimacy associated with it, in many regions of the world tongue kissing in public is not acceptable to most, particularly in the case of extended duration. See: public display of affection.\n\nIn a tongue kiss participants may exchange saliva, which would often be considered disgusting in other contexts, but which may add to the passion and excitement of the sexual kiss. Although most sexually-transmitted diseases are not transmitted by kissing, the exchange of saliva in a French kiss may increase the chances of catching an orally transmitted disease. Infectious Mononucleosis (American: Mononucleosis or, colloquially, ""mono""; European: Glandular Fever), a disease spread through saliva, is often colloquially referred to as ""the kissing disease.""",Society & Culture
