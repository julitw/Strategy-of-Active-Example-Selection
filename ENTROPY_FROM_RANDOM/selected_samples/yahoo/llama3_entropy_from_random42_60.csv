"Title: How can you get out of the army?, Content: Before I met my wife (when she was 17) her Ex-Navy father got mad at her and drove her down to the army recruiting station and forced her to enlist. She was officially sworn in at MEPS the following march, the very day of her 18th birthday. We met a few days after she was sworn in. We married in July she is in Basic training now. She was so scared when she left, she is sacred now, she never wanted to go, she was just afraid to say no to her Dad. Her dream is to be a veterinarian, but her Dad got her signed up as an Infantry Supply clerk. Is there anyway to save her from this nightmare. Is there anyway to get her discarged?, Answer: She should stay in.  Basic will probably be the hardest thing she'll have to do.  After she gets out, she can go anywhere as a supply clerk.  Probably won't go to a combat area unless she requests it.\nSo she gets stationed somewhere states side.  It's like a 9-5 job most of the time.  She come in, do her job, and go home.  She'll get housing, so you can join her.\nIt'll pay for her school to be a veterinarian.  Hell, she can go to some night classes and get all the prerequisites outta the way before she gets out.\nHowever, if she really wants out and she is in basic...all she has to do is ask.  They will try to talk her out of it.  Probably bad mouth her.  Call her names.  Etc.  But they will give her a general discharge..or a less than honorable discharge I think they called it.\nWe had someone go awol while I was in basic and they just mailed him his less than honorable.  They don't want to spend too much money on someone and just have them leave.  They may sound tough on her...but they will let her leave if she wants.  Have her talk to the military pastor/preacher.  He can help her. \nOn that note...make sure she wants to and she's not just echoing what you want...this less than honorable discharge will follow her everywhere.",Politics & Government

This will help if you catch the same people in the act next time.\n\nAnother precaution you can take (besides locking up the car and house securely and/or with an alarm) is to engrave a code number on your stuff, and write down the code number on a separate piece of paper that you put in safe-keeping.  Then if you know who took the stuff, the police can check for the code number you provide them, and that will be enough evidence for them to reclaim the property and charge the criminals.\n\nGood luck!",Business & Finance
