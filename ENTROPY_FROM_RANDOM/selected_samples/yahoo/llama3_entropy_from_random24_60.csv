"Title: Here's one for all you dream interpreters in the crowd>>>>>>>>>>?, Content: What does it mean when a person's dreams are almost always unpleasant. I'm not talking nightmares here, just that very seldom do I have what I'd call a pleasant dream. Does this mean that I am a poorly adjusted, unhappy human being? If not that, then what does it mean? Also, if a recognizable face appears in my dreams, it's usually that of my father, who's been deceased for nearly 18 years. These dreams tend to be neutral, not particularly pleasant or unpleasant. Thanks for your help., Answer: Keep a dream diary beside your bed and write it all down as soon as you wake up. Check out the tons of dream dictionary sites online for specific images in your dreams.

"Title: Christians, what do you think about this dream I had last night?, Content: A man was driving west through Arizona on an interstate highway when he looked at his dashboard and saw he was almost out of gas.  There were no roadside stations in sight but he needed gas very soon.  The next exit was for a small town about 3 miles off the interstate so he took the exit to find gas.  It was a cold, wet, windy, winter day and as he traveled down the road to the little town he noticed a young man walking on the side of the road toward the interstate.  With little concern he traveled on to the town and filled up his tank.  \n\nAs he turned and drove back to the interstate he came upon the young  man again.  He was wearing a light jacket holding his arms close to his chest leaning forward into the freezing wind and rain obviously miserable and cold.  As the car approached the young man on the road he just barely put out his left thumb so as to indicate he needed a lift but trying to maintain some body heat.\n\nAs the driver passed by the young  man something inside him told him to stop.  He had never before stopped to pick up anyone like this before.  He brought his car to a stop about a quarter mile down the road from the young man.  As he turned to look back through the rear windshield he could see the young man running down the road toward his car.  Soon the young man was standing at the passenger door looking in the through the window the driver had lowered.  \n\n“I sure could use a lift,” said the young man.  The driver asked,  “which way do you need to go?”  The young man replied, “I need to go east.  Are you going that way?”  The driver hesitated for just a moment and then said, “Yeah.  I’m going east.  Get in.”\n\nThe young man almost jumped into the car.  His hair was covered in ice and with the warmth of the car it began to melt and drip from his hair.  As the driver pulled onto the road heading back to the highway he asked the young man, “where do you need to go?”  He replied, “I’m trying to get to my dad’s house in Virginia”.  The driver said, “That’s a long way to hitch hike don’t you think?  Why didn’t you call you dad and get some help getting back home?”\n\nThe young man replied, “ I haven’t talked to my dad in 5 years.  I left home on bad terms with him.  I was doing some things I new I shouldn’t do and dad didn’t approve.  So I left and said I’m never coming back.  Now I’ve lost my job.  I’ve lost my girl friend.  I have no money, no friends, and no place to live.  I don’t have anything left and nowhere to go.  I was afraid to call him. What if he said no I can’t come home?  Then what would I do?  Where would I go?  I thought if I can just make it back home maybe I can walk up and knock on his door.  Tell him how sorry I am.  Maybe he would let me come home.”\n\nThe driver pulled his car onto the interstate and headed east retracing the path from which he had just come.  The two continued to talk about what had happened in the young man’s life.  \n\nAs they drove and talked they soon came to a large city.  The driver without saying why began following the signs that showed the way to the airport.  The young man asked, “Where are we going.”  The driver responded, “I’m going to pay for a ticket for you to fly home.  You need to be with your dad.”  The two went into the airport together where the driver bought the ticket.  He handed it to the young man and said, “you’d better hurry you’re going to miss your flight.”  The young man hugged the driver and then with tears in his eyes he said, “You know, you didn’t have to do this, did you?”  \n\nThe driver paused for just a moment and looking back into the young man’s eyes responded, “ Yeah, I think I did.”\n\nI then found myself looking up a the crucified Jesus hanging on the cross looking down into my eyes.  I looked up at him acknowledging what He had done for me and with tears in my eyes I said, “You know, You didn’t have to do this, did You?”   \n\nJ, Answer: Very nice dream.  Thanks for posting it.  The representation in the dream is very good.  We the human family through rebellion and disobedience left our Heavenly Father, just like the boy in this dream left his father.  We then often find ourselves in dire situations, and want our Heavenly Father to forgive us and help us just like this boy did.  Jesus then, just like the kind man in this dream, paid the price and ticket to made possible for us to be forgiven and get back to our Father. \n\n Father forgive us and teach us that truth that sets us free (John 8:32).",Society & Culture

Often acoustic guitar with soft, high male vocals that dwell exessively on the singer's feelings, especially melancholy remembrances of past relationships/mistakes in life. A form of music that diverged from punk in the '80s, the name ""emo"" is derived from the emotive style of the lyrics and music. This genre has lately been marketed heavily by the music industry to teenagers with bands such as Dashboard Confessional and Taking Back Sunday, and has seen much commercial and mainstream success. The music has also spawned a subculture which conforms to certain conventions in dress such as tight sweatshirts, tight band T-shirts and horn-rim glasses. Adherents profess to exessively melancholy temperments. Males that adhere to the emo subculture are sometimes confused with metrosexuals; indeed the line between the two is somwhat blurred, though both groups claim to be intouch with their emotional side. The ephemeral and hackneyed nature of emo songwriting suggests that its audience will be restricted largely to teenagers. the genre suffers from a lack of credibility outside the aforementioned demographic group, much like current Nu Metal bands.\n\n \n\nAn entire subculture of people (usually angsty teens) with a fake personality. The concept of Emo is actually a vicious cycle that never ends, to the utter failing of humanity, and it goes something like this:\n\n1. Girls say they like ""sensitive guys"" (lie)\n2. Guy finds out, so he listens to faggy emo music and dresses like a dork so chicks will see that he is sensitive and not afraid to express himself (lie). He dyes his hair black, wraps himself in a stupid looking scarf, develops an eating disorder, and rants about how ""nobody understands"".\n3. Now an emo guy, he meets Emo chick and they start dating, talking about how their well-off suburban lifestyles are terrible and depressing (lie)\n4. Emo guy is just too much of a pussy. His penis is too small, he's too depressed to bathe, and has more mood swings than emo chick, and he doesn't even have a menstrual cycle. Emo chick dumps him, saying ""It's not you, it's me."" (lie) as she drives off with Wayne, the school jock and captain of the football team.\n5. Emo guy goes home and cries, proceeds to write a weak song and strum a single string on his acoustic guitar. Another emo chick sees how he is so in touch with his feelings, and the cycle continues.\n\nThis is the sad truth of the emo lifestyle/music, and now that I look at how pathetic it really is, maybe the emos DO have something to cry about!\n\nWhen she sees how sensitive and emo I have become, she'll definately go out with me!",Health

"Title: who leads a happier life the illegal or the anti?, Content: i say the illegal, antis sound uptight and hateful, Answer: Generally speaking, a person who devotes time and energy to a cause which demeans the persona of another human being different than themselves suffers from  at the least  what is termed in professional psychiatry jargon, ""Personality Disorder"" syndrome. This condition can lead to further  serious emotional problems when it is nourished by  an external reinforcement mechanisms such as the participation  in  a larger group  holding similar ideas. As an example, the evident characteristics displayed during  the  mass rallies held by Isalmists as they scream their hatred for the Americans, are  manifestations of this type of psychological degeneration. Similar behavior can be witnessed in  a group closer to us, and that would be   the minutemen who each has internalized this victimized objectification of the 'Mexican"" illegal. In this case you also have misplaced blame for whatever personal failures or fears they suppress or deny. The leaders of such groups can also be further classified into Messianic , Grandiose personality, sociopaths, whether it is Hitler or the local head of the KKK you are talking about..\nTherefore this would explain the depressive characteristics of the typical anti-undocumented. But remember that on the surface this comes out as anger. Fear is often at the core of both Anger and Hate. DM",Politics & Government

"Title: Can the HOLY TRINITY be revealed in How we are Created in God's Image?, Content: God is spirit. He cannot be seen. If you were to examine all the creatures, the CREATOR has made a pattern emerges: angels and demons are intellectual creatures without a body; plants and animals do not have an intellect but a body and mortal soul. IT IS ONLY LIVING, HUMAN, BEINGS, that have a MIND, BODY, and SOUL. Only human beings have all three. Now, living, human, being is the existence of man. Those words describe the essence of man's mind, body, and soul. The Body is living, the Mind makes us human and distinguishing us from animals, and our Soul makes us the being that we become (good or evil).\n\nNow, even Muslims will agree Allah is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing), and omnipresent (ever present). These words describe the existence of God. So, what is the essence of God? I will hold off answering this question till the end., Answer: God the Father, mind\nGod the Son, body\nGod the Holy Spirit - soul\nHuman - made up of body, mind, and soul; therefore in the image of God - the Trinity",Society & Culture
"Title: Do you think illegal immigrants help or hurt the economy?, Content: , Answer: The approximately 40 million illegal immigrants in this country definitely hurt the economy.  \n\nThey took away a lot of jobs like roofing and construction jobs from the American people.  You used to see two white or black men putting on the roof.  Now you see 14 illegal aliens on a roof - all making below minimum wage.\n\nAnd most of their money gets sent back to Mexico.  That hurts the economy also.\n\nIllegals have put a real stand still on health care for millions of Americans.  I had cervical cancer while I lived in South Texas.  The doctor's office gave me an ""emergency"" appointment for 6 months away.  They couldn't see or treat me and the entire building was filled with illegal aliens and their 8 to 10 children. And of course the mothers were all pregnant.\n\nWell, I took my belongings in a bag and took the Greyhound bus to West Tennessee to live our the rest of my life.  They gave me surgery immediately and today I am cancer free.\n\nI would have died if I remained in South Texas.....)(",Politics & Government
