simply stated anonymity absence identity ultimate privacy however several variations simple theme person may wish consistently identified certain pseudonym handle establish reputation area providing pseudoanonymity person may wish completely untraceable single oneway message sort hitandrun person may wish openly anonymous carry conversation others either known anonymous identities via anonymous

risky situation anonymity allows conversations carried completely independent identities participants police departments run phone services allow anonymous reporting crimes uses would straightforward

accounts accessable anonymous eg public telephones may effective well use generally officially supported even discouraged system adminstrators nsf guidelines nonuniformity requirements obtaining accounts different sites institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult obtain public large many communications protocols inherently detrimental anonymity virtually every protocol existence currently contains information sender receiver every packet new communications protocols likely develop guarantee much higher degrees secure anonymous communication anonymous mail one approach anonymizing mail set anonymous server activated email address responds allocating supplying anonymous id unique person requesting based email address vary person different machine address email originations send anonymous mail user sends email directed server containing final destination server anonymizes message stripping identification information forwards message appears originate anonymous server corresponding anonymous user id interactive use anonymity pseudonymity mentioned another fringe approach run cypherpunk remailer regular user account root system privileges required currently pioneered eric hughes hal finney operator runs process machine anonymizes mail sent certain characteristics distinguish regular incoming mail typically fields header one implemented perl

addresses mail incorrectly addressed received operator generally user remailer disavow responsibility messages forwarded system although actually may held liable regardless approaches several serious disadvantages weaknesses anonymous server approach requires maintaining mapping anonymous ids real addresses must maintained indefinitely one alternative allow deallocation aliases request user

refined systems standards progressing slowly weakly field likely improve considerably without official endorsement action network agencies whole idea essentially still infancy viewed suspicion distrust many internet seen illegitimate favorable criminality major objection anonymity regular internet use perceived lack accountability system operators ie invulnerability account restrictions resulting outside complaints system adminstrators sites threatened filter anonymous news postings generated prominent servers redistribution flows may effect encouraging server operators create less characteristically detectable headers probably least problematic approach traditional usenet individual users deal anonymous mail however prefer eg ignoring filtering kill files future anonymity internet new anonymous protocols effectively serve significantly increase safeguards anonymity example mechanism routes email multiple hosts thereby threatening privacy also used guarantee scheme called chaining anonymous message passed multiple anonymous servers reaching destination way generally multiple links chain broken security compromised reencryption link makes scenario even unlikely even significantly anonymous remailers could spread internet globally local weaknesses corrupt governments legal wiretapping within nation would unlikely sacrifice overall security message tracing

distribution mechanisms moderated alt groups past example part new group creation charter may specify whether anonymous posting unwelcome nevertheless widespread introduction use anonymity may
