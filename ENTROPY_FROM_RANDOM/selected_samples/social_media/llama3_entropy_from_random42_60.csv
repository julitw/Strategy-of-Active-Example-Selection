"untouchable since day 1 : I thought I'd let everyone know that I've lived my life to the fullest. From being wanted to being arrested but too young to go to prison.

I've not only had an article made on me in the past for stealing thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency but since being gone for over a year I'm back and better. 

I'm currently sitting on top of $950,000 worth of stolen crypto and guess what? NO ONE CAN FUCKING CATCH ME.

Selenium and Magnesium can help a lot with depression : I have depression myself it’s been very severe for a while but I’ve done research on what causes the chemical imbalances and how to fix them as well as what else is wrong. Mercury seems to be the main cause of depression and all mental illness but Selenium and Magnesium can get rid of it over the course of months. These two minerals are both antioxidants themselves and also both increase Glutathione which is the most important antioxidant in the body. Antioxidants fight oxidative a which is a major factor in depression. Selenium also increases metallothionein which is crucial for a good blood-brain barrier and protection from heavy metals. I’m taking these right now although only recently started but I just wanted to tell whoever sees this that there are a lot of different supplements that can help immensely with depression because they help the body deal with what’s wrong and what’s lacking. I highly recommend anybody struggling like me to start taking these two supplements it can’t hurt it can help a lot it could even cure your depression if it is from mercury toxicity like it is a lot of the time.,severe
"How long do Mirtazapine side effects last? : [Throwaway account because my gf follows me]
My partner has just come off 2 months of 30mg mirtazapine for depression and anxiety, due to it not really helping, and because of the frustrating (mainly sexual) side effects (the usual, but far worse than other meds) that appeared as soon as she started taking it. 
This has obviously sucked for both of us, our sex life is nonexistent recently. Luckily we’re very open when it comes to things like this, so it didn’t cause any tension or frustration. 
I’m on sertraline and have been on other antidepressants, so I can empathise with what she’s feeling, but I’ve never been on mirtazapine, so my question to anyone with experience with this medication is:
Assuming you experienced similar problems, how long did it take for your sex drive to return, and were there any long term issues?
Thanks in advance",severe

"Anti depressants killing sex drive? : Basically my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago was diagnosed with depression. 
It makes sense she lost her dad earlier this year and she’s not been treated right at work, she started a course of anti depressants, she takes a tablet called Setraline? I think it’s called that. 

Im trying my best to be there for her as much as possible, doing what I can to reassure her and just generally be there for her. 

Anyway, to the title... me and my girlfriend have gone from having the most amazing sex life to it being non existent this past couple of weeks, of course sex isn’t at the fore front of her mind and that makes sense... however, something she said last night got me thinking “Is this normal” .

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression
"Some here have gone through psychiatric internment. Some haven't. If you have any questions, I'm here to answer them. : Hey.
It's very often that I see people here discussing their experience with therapy, psychiatry and mental healthcare. All of these vary according to every person, and in the case of the last aspect, every country. 
I'm a Spanish teenager and was interned after almost committing suicide in February 2019. A year ago now. I was put into a ward meant for adolescents (15-17), specifically. I live in a region with a population of nearly 5.000.000, whose total capacity for at-risk teens is... 5 rooms. Individual ones. Only 5 teens can receive attention. You will hardly ever see someone leave in less than 2 weeks, and you'll almost never see someone spend more than 4. It's just a quick fix. A patch. Momentary safety.
For all you who have gone through internment, what was your experience like?
For those who haven't, feel free to ask here. I would've preferred to know about it before heading right into it. It's useful info.",not depression

"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

"My mum died two days ago, my heart is hurting so bad : I feel like I will never stop crying and feeling teary. My heart feels so sad for my Mum who won't get to do the things she loved anymore. She'll never get to feel the warmth again and get a really dark tan like she always did. It destroys me that her death could have been possibly prevented if she had been treated sooner. She was only 54, she should still be here. 

I'm torturing myself thinking of all the stupid times that I didn't act the way I should have just because I was too depressed. Or the things I didn't do that she asked me too or hinted/suggested. I had the ability to make her happy and I didnt. I upset her just because of my negative mind and how effected she was by me. All the lost moments where I was in the room but my mind wasn't present in the slightest.

She was suffering for a long time with alcoholism and unfortunately cancer took over her body. I feel like more could have been done to stop her from dying, I feel like I should have done more and been more helpful with her physical and mental health. I should have realised she was so unwell in the weeks before her death, there were days when I would look at her and just think oh god you look so unwell, why did I not say something? She might still be here if she had got to the hospital earlier. 

My heart hurts thinking about whether she was scared or worried. Whether she knew she was dying or had accepted her fate. Whether she knew she was leaving us and how distraught we were. When she was awake but delirious I couldn't look at her without crying, she must've known something was wrong because she almost never saw me cry. It brings me some peace to know she can't think and can't hurt anymore, her mind is resting and she is free from the pain of life.

I honestly don't know how i'll get over this, I realise only now that she was such an important factor in my life, I depended on her and she depended on me. I should've been there for her.",moderate
