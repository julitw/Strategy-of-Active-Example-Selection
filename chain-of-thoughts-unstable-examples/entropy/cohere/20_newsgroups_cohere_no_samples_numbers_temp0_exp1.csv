zechariah reads little differently lo king comes triumphant victorious humble riding ass ass colt command peace nations isnt much difference except zechariah involves one animal asscolt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthews version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier st mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt

record quite well might ask jesus matthew havent read source reads psalms yahweh lord majestic name whole world whose glory chanted heavens babes infants founded bulwark foes still enemy avenger passages hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given gd messiah king jesus mentioned seems one case matthews pen making convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said lord jesus said asked promised jewish messiahking descended jews agree king david jesus counters quoting psalms lord said lord sit right hand put enemies feet taken face value jesus denying necessity davidic descent one assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiahking tempting believe one christian interested matters investigation problems jesuss time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better davids rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesuss time also made one must remember various factions among jews often result different expectations messiahking jesus apparently one adventists like audience thought messiahs advent imminent interpreted psalms among others messianic problem psalm literally reads yhvhs utterance lord sit right hand make enemies footstool yhvh sends forth mighty scepter zion rule midst foes people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order melchizedek forever word lord often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity lord hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord generic term would use used often scriptures refer kings gd merely address respect nothing text imply word refers either divinity messiahking supposed written david certain title psalm translates either psalm david psalm david seems fitting assume written court poet davids covenant endorsement gd psalm written david unlikely would talking messiah idea perfect king descended david present davids age extensive tales davids doings sayings none include

pharisees became religious competition infant christianity target jesuss question might expect matthew writes event ends embarrassing pharisees power pen moses jesus together along leave gospel story

throwing pieces silver temple judas departed chief priests taking silver said isnt lawful us put treasury since blood money bought potters field bury strangers fulfilled spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty pieces silver price price set sons israel gave potters field lord directed prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament scripture first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet zechariah utters verses matthew makes use zech weighed wages thirty shekels silver yhvh said cast treasury lordly price paid took thirty shekels silver cast treasury house yhvh first verses zechariah deal betrayer messiah gd deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly gd would send judah israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthews quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariahs context whereas potters field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthews track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judass situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests would put money treasury worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite course average thursdaynight bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthews work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified mt gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted would drink crucified divided garments among casting lots might fulfilled spoken prophet parted garments among upon vesture cast lots first vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine type roman soldiers drank regularly find right jesus dies soldiers give drink polluted gall jn jesus said thirst bowl vinegar stood put sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth received vinegar said finished matthew seems drawing passage prophets one psalms ps looked pity none comforters found none gave poison food lit put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink add punishment upon punishment may acquittal thee let blotted book living course sour wine offered jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks gd damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospels says lk jesus said father forgive dont know matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesuss drink meat psalm stipulates prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings nd psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesuss clothes divided told great thing turns happened often felon days soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesuss clothes man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions nd psalm psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemies becomes song praise yhvh hope taken context parts seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse god god forsaken far helping far words groaning oh god cry day dont answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like lamb led mute shearers indeed jesus doesnt much groaning even cross certainly cry day night cross worm man scorned men see mock make faces wag heads committed cause yhvh let deliver delights seems fit jesuss execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm many bulls encompass open mouths widely like ravening roaring lion yea dogs round company evildoers encircle pierced hands feet see bones divide garments among cast lost raiment yhvh far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion afflicted soul horns wild bull would seem quite convincing im sure early christian fathers wrote prophecy thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words pierced really exist psalm correct hebrew translation yea dogs round company evildoers encircles like lion hands feet hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion kaari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word kaaru add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translators chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty translators apart erroneous verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalms true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce hands palms rather forearms doesnt say much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples scars palms facts arent bound religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability time attempt draw many direct links psalm lord jesus psalm like many others minds gospel writers compiled stories interpretations jesuss life death much scriptures may contributed actually got written question serious repercussions christian theology easy see faithful fundamentalists events new testament might enhanced scribes eager matthew less speculate simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims far said good things st matthew reference piercing looks lot like jesuss crucifixion johns gospel recount written years fact tells us jesuss execution jn one soldiers pierced side spear came blood water things took place scripture fulfilled look theyve pierced course built passage taken blatantly context prophet zechariah tells us much nation israel split jerusalem judah go war zc yhvh give victory judah day seek destroy nations come jerusalem judah pour spirit compassion supplication jerusalem look pierced mourn weep bitterly like weep firstborn child johns attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker matthews attempts matthew least usually excontexts one passage johns errors grossly obvious blatant speak well gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded reckoned transgressors arrest jesus quickly executed claiming jewish kingship messiahship according one version gospel tale jesus gets executed along two thieves mk crucified two robbers one right one left scripture fulfilled says reckoned transgressors mark trying link jesus passage isaiah servant nation israel passage messiah one reads whole chapter isaiah surrounding chapters one sees servant nation verses also servant gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal also happens fit description jesus passage really messiah still clear executing jesus two thieves would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesus would fittingly fulfill whole ministry considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least case see mark could made better analogy general comparisons mark goes tell us crucified jesus also reviled expected couple robbers course later recount st luke decides change things luke tells us lk one criminals hanged railed arent messiah save us certainly fits marks recount tells people crucified jesus said save robbers luke goes criminal rebuked first saying dont fear gd since sentence condemnation indeed justly receiving due reward deeds man done nothing wrong said jesus remember come kingdom jesus answered verily say today paradise little dialogue seems highly contrived stretches imagination bit see picture one ruffian rebuking

508,mr decenso spite requiring scholarly opinion hanging judas rejects scholarly opinion scholars rephrases scholars opinion subject know matthew hang acts probably records death although possible plausible fell hanging hit rocks thereby bursting open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say judas died result hanging scholars believe iprobably quoted show highly regard scholars explanations looking texts initially cant assume judas died however highly probable also nothing greek suggest success failure simply means hang oneself actually research greek word apacgw find denote success scholars indeed excellent reason assume suicide successful pointed recently checked several lexicons greek english lexicon new testament louw nida robinsons greek english lexicon new testament greek english lexicon new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale greek english lexicon new testament early christian writings bauerarndtgingrich new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher couple simply stated hanged oneself couple explicit stated apacgw means specifically kill hanging couple also noted meaning one root words apacgw strangle throttle choke pretty much invalidates guy suggested david joslin judas hung upside one best references though robinsons greek english lexicon new testament stated translation gave root words literal translation related greek words use roots also presented specific examples word greek literature give context word apagchw two root words gchw strangle root root word apo means literally away root words included words denote transition mean transition place eg greek word apagello means send message apo also denote change state specifically change life death robinson specifically makes comparison word apokteiuo means kill literal meaning word apacgw means throttle strangle put way implicitly denotes change life state ie away life death word apacgw mean hang specifically denotes death well thus robinson quite specific state means hang oneself end ones life hanging notes use apacgw homers odessy denote context presents example apacgw used explicitly mean suicide hanging since perfectly good word strangling without added denotation death insist bible written god every word precicely correct stuck complete meaning apacgw ie since word apacgw used death denoted result way note mr decenso also presents example apacgw septuagint greek translation ot used time jesus used samuel ahithophel saw advice followed saddled donkey arose went home house city put household order hanged died buried fathers tomb notice stated ahithophel hanged gr sept apagcho explicitly adds died doubt result matthew explicitly told judas died note mr decenso say septuagint translation hebrew greek shown original meaning hebrew ie hebrew say died thus whether simply echoed greek also pointed regardless added died correct translation would still apacgw man indeed die strangulation redundant correct evidence septuagint repeatedly rewritten reedited included versions contradicted editing even necessarily executed greeks thus sure use septuagint stands paragon ancient greek really need prove point mr decenso example ancient greek someone committing apacgw surviving otherwise would see simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence would note mr decenso everytime go way research one apparently contrived exegisis pretty much find false thus think going add text something source clearly says better explicit greek historical source justify way mr roses statement trees around potters field still trees around ledges rocky pavement bottom unless mr rose show trees two thousand years old year old stumps thousand year old description area mentions trees inappropriate assert present placement trees prove location trees two thousand years ago things change argument ie money judas used silvers second question mr decenso ask could sure money judas purchased land indeed betrayal rather source would point acts specifically mention reward iniquity acts also specifically mentions act iniquity talking ie acts concerning judas guide arrested jesus would point bible describes act iniquity immediately discusses reward iniquity would rather inane suggest action iniquity one discussed notice verse word iniquity used rather states judas became guide arrested jesus writer stop therevs numbered us obtained part ministry part judas play ministry true peter author acts specifically call judas betrayal iniquity matter neither john specifically call judas actions iniquity either john say judas took money box rather said thought judas money box jesus telling buy need feast give something poor receiving morsel immediately went night note said judas left say took money box thus see explanation still seems would choose unproven iniquity mentioned another author different book written different time iniquity explicitly mentioned author acts find forced contrived course particular argument becomes moot since seen evidence apacgw means suicide see since judas hanging successful could spent money mentioned john matthew mark explicitly say betrayal high holy day ie passover thus could spent money killing next day thus money bought field blood would pieces silver course got pieces silver night well thus couldnt spent either oh dear believe house cards comming maybe point discuss whether jesus crucified friday saturday part argument judas way prophesy potters field came ie mention matthew say please done study death remind discuss reminding discuss part verse discussing wish would quit procrastinating sidestepping issues later dave butler wise man proportions belief evidence david hume philosopher inquiry concerning human understanding ps would note stating bible possibly

along look precisely cruise missile blew building bits odd little suffering iraqi civilians towards end war confined remaining quality newspapers true first news media seemed entranced new gizmos military using mention taped video transmissions missiles zeroed targets later especially bunker full civilians hit changed tone seemed didnt stomach reality war innocent people really die maimed warfare like progulfwar long nice clean smart missiles dropping military hqs pictures dead dying maimed civilians started cropping naive hypocrites innocent people died blanketbombing ww dont hear bemoaning discussion blanketbombing abombs deleted things considered firebombings atomic bomb essential therefore justified bringing war quick end avoid even greater allied losses said militarily justified seems comments understood meaning morally justified apologize evidence america knew japan surrender hiroshima nagasaki another lie peddled liberal media conspiracy often wondered ive always thought first bomb dropped japans island fortress truk good inpenatrable military target second bomb couldve held back use industrial center need digress yes heard found evidence war btw japan seriously considering surrender first bomb unfortunately military junta moderates rejected uss ulimatum therefore second bomb dropped unfortunate imo one dont regret nuke jap jesus dont regret fact sometimes military decisions made affect lives innocent people regret circumstances make decisions necessary regret suffering caused decisions fuss kuwait east timor bosnia even tibet iraq bad still selling stuff couple weeks started bombing make claim effort justify misguided foreign policy west war evident west especially america misjudged hussein drastically hussein invaded kuwait threatened
