0,"Fuck titles. I’m depressed : I feel so fucking worthless around everyone I speak to. My parents ignore me when I say I’m depressed. They ignore me on my birthday and holidays. My own friends ignore me and treat me like shit. I texted my girlfriend and told her how utterly fucking depressed I am, and all she replied with was “Oof”. I mean literally nothing to the people I am around.

I spend most of my time online watching videos from people who have way better lives than I will ever have. The second my eyes leave the screen, the static starts to speak my name. Being left alone with my thoughts is hell.

I don’t even want to post this, but what the hell.  Nothing matters.",moderate
1,"Feeling like I’m losing my battle : Ever since December was ending, I became more depressed and suicidal. Now every time I wake up, I’m upset that I’m awake. It makes me wonder if the depression medication I’m on... is actually making me feel more suicidal than I was before. It’s worrying me a little because it’s the new year and my will to live is fading. I feel like lately I have no energy. I’m more sensitive emotionally. I just want to lay in bed since video games doesn’t appeal to me as much as they use to. I can’t tell anyone my feelings because I have a hard time opening up. I haven’t started therapy because the therapist was booked and I won’t call the suicide hotline when I feel suicidal because I heard bad things about it. It just sucks that when I finally get help. I start the new year wanting to die x10000 more than I usually do.",moderate
2,It's 2020 and I want to meet new people : I posted this in r/introvert and my Snapchat is kb_shaw324 and I was wondering if anyone would be interested if we started sharing Snapchats or other social media apps in the comments so maybe we could all have some to talk to that is like us? We could even create a group chat if that's something people would be interested in? Don't be afraid to tell me if this is the dumbest idea ever.,not depression
3,"here we go again : School is starting back again in a few days and I’m dreading it with my whole soul. I was having suicidal thoughts a month ago and  that dissipated just teeny bit. I know once school will start again, its going to come flowing back... I won’t be able to hide in my room anymore. And now I dread school even more then ever now because I’ve fucked up a friendship up by being too emotional. I feel out of my fucking mind. What the fuck is wrong with me. I almost deserve dying. I’m so fucking angry at myself and everything. I can’t even put into words what I feel and its really frustrating",moderate
4,"My Story : I forgot to take my meds and I can't get to them as I'm staying at a friend's and it would mean waking them up, so I am stuck awake until I leave to go back to London tomorrow at 11am-ish

This year has been probably my toughest ever. I've been trying to come to terms with the ending of a really special friendship between a couple and I, a whole group of friends due to lies being spread about me that included my best friend I made on the fetish scene and two friends died, one to suicide and one to a heart attack. I was made redundant from the first job I have had last longer than a year and a half since 2008 due to moving my role outside of London, I've had problems and uncertainty over my living situation and culminating in my Dad having a heart attack about two weeks before Christmas.

In the last six months, I've I purposely asked my therapist to start trying to help me come to terms with my own abuse, but unfortunately, my own mental health went down the more we spoke about it. This was around June time and around that time I met my now ex play partner. As I am on the fetish and BDSM scene, having a play partner is kind of like a FWB but you meet up, hang out, ""play"", have sex, whatever... Problem being, I pretty much fell for her the moment I saw her.

She is everything I want in a partner, funny, cute, curvy, into the same music (BIG BIG THING for me) and into the same kinks, even the ones I am ashamed of / scared of sharing with others. She always said she wasn't over her ex and didn't want anything serious but with her being exactly what I want in someone, I couldn't help but fall for her. She is literally only the second person ever in my life that when I met for the first time, my heart skipped a beat and I felt like my jaw dropped like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf.

She pulled away from me twice through kink guilt and then the final time happened in mid-Oct, I didn't realise how serious it was and how much it really was over for a few weeks afterwards when she told me she had feelings for someone else. This was the lynchpin that when it was pulled away, started my breakdown. I broke down to my housemate's girlfriend and sobbed my heart out so hard and for so long, my other housemates came to find out what had happened. I ended up in such a panicked state, I had to call the Samaritans for help. I ended up calling a few different helplines to try and get somewhere but it didn't amount to much.

I ended up going to the Accident and Emergency (ER to the US readers) because I was so low, I was worried I would do something stupid. They didn't do much but eventually, they referred me to the brief intervention team... which I only heard from after a series of shitty and frustrating events. I have spoken to doctors and spoken with a clinical psychologist now and they've referred me to a psychiatrist but STILL waiting on this too.

I still talk her occasionally but she's super short in her answers and it just hurts. I've only seen her once to give her belongings back, but any time she puts on update on the website we met through or her IG, I get anxious and upset, but I can't unfollow / delete / block because something in me isn't ready to let go. She's everything I want in someone I just can't bear to think that I could miss out on being with her. We'll end up running into each other at some events eventually but I know I will have to leave because it will hurt too much.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm lost, so lonely, I feel ugly, I'm overweight and no one wants to be with me and no one EVER wants to be with me how I want to be with them.

Since I broke up with my wife at the start of 2015, I have had about eight partnerships but none were anything serious, no matter how much I wanted them to be. It's been ten years since I have felt like I was getting what I needed from a relationship and I'm lonelier that I have ever been. I have some better tools to cope with the down times that I did before but I'm still hurting so so much and I just want a ray of sunshine, someone that makes my heart skip, someone to show me the love I want to give them, but no one I want to be with, wants me, they never have and I feel like they never will.

I was a really late bloomer in school and I didn't start having relationships till I was 15 plus and then didn't have consensual sex till I was 17 plus and the only reason I did end up dating people and such was because they were the first people to come along and show interest in me. I honestly ended up in relationships with people who were bad for me from the start for the pure reason that they showed interest and somewhere in my \*\*\*\*ing brain just went ""QUICK! DON'T TURN THEM DOWN! YOU'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE, NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE!""

I'm just so so tired, so lonely, so upset and so scared that I'll never be happy again. I don't want my Dad to die before he know I have someone who loves me and I love them. My parents are in their 70's now and they are starting to show real signs of aging and losing either of them could really be the end of me.

Sorry, this post has gone all over the place, just very tired (mentally) and just want someone there to hold me, to give me a kiss, gently stroke my back as they pass me while out with a group of friends, just anything to know that someone cares enough to touch me. I need contact with people, if I were to see friends 99% of the day for a week, but had to physical contact, I might as well have been alone, because I need it to fell like someone cares and right now, no matter how many screenshots I save from those that reply to my posts, no matter how many phone calls, whatsapp's or whatever, nothing can replace that contact, especially from someone that I want to be with and they want to be with me

Just wish things were very very different. Thank you for reading.... Safe journeys",not depression
5,"I totally lost it at the very beggining of 2020 :  

01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know,

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Anyway I started new year/decade with the right move, didn't I?

Joking...

7,"I am struggling with every aspect of my life : Background: 27/F of south asian decent. I struggled a lot with my feeling in highschool. I has a estranged relationship with my parents. They had moved to Canada and has white collar jobs back home but here they felt frustrated and more often than not they would take it out on me. I worked on farms and helped ends meet. I quickly realized I wasn't quite like the other kids, falling for boys and doing the popular thing. I started to become very internalized and depressed. I even tried to kill myself a few times. But I was chicken shit and never did manage to succeed. My parents pressured me to do online classes skip a grade and be smart. I did most, but in grade 12 I was struggling a lot. I finished school with a great GPA, but I never finished my online class. I just had too much on my plate( my mental health was really bad here) anyways I decided to switch my major and take that class while I did the other intro classes at school. I told my parents, they decide I was horrible and I got yet another beating. I tried to keep it up. I was 17 and too scared to take a student loan so I got a night job and started working and school.during the day. With my mental health being the way it was and animosity at home I was struggling. My grades at school.staryed to drop, I started to get worse and worse. After two semester and realizing I wasnt going to succeeed I decided to quit school, I moved out and spent a month just sleeping. I was so mentally exhausted. I then looked for a job. I found a decent job working in a lab, I started to save as I eventually wanted to return to university. I went back to tutoring, since I was tutoring in highschool some of my networks were still around, so I approached them. Back in highschool I used to tutor at my parents home. The students asked if I was able to do that again. I approached my parents hesitant, offered to share part of my earning and tutor there. They said sure 50-50. Hey that was more money than I was making now so it would only help me save more. Time goes on, our relationship seems better, they tell me they miss me and I should move home. I am foolish because I believe them as I am moving home a year later. Enrolling in local college to do a bridge program and get into the program I want. I am lonely and have no friends and my parents are back to yelling and hating me. I look for friends more importantly I am looking for love. Highschool people made jokes about me being gay to me, I ignored them. Ofcourse they weren't wrong. But I wasn't the in crowd so I couldn't afford to be gay aswell. So here I am thinking I am on path to sorting my shit out at 19 and I meet this woman at the college. She seems really interested we hit it off, she tell me she loves me and I am puddy. I do everything she wants. Things at my home are tense so i find any and every excuse to stay out and with her. One day she needs financial help and I being an idiot let her have my savings with a promise she will return them within a semester and then she changes. She starts seeing exes and new people. She calls me names, she makes me feel gross about myself and I gain a bunch of weight. My doctor says my health is no good. I am hardly sleeping. I am prescribed xanax. I hate it so I just let myself cry for days and not leave my room. I started seeing a counselor at the college. Cut back to taking just one class so I can have health insurance and work for a year and half and save. Get a car. My.parents are fighting everything i do. Constantly calling me names, I am still being beat up. I start going to jiu jitsu. At 24, I get a handle on my head a bit. I have sat down and decide I am.taking a student loan and studying. I study hard and finishing the engineering bridge program. I have meet someonei think I like I am taking it slow.I had applied to school close but not in the same city so I could justify moving. I am 25 So I move to the island near my city and get admission to a good engineering school. I go to visit the person I have been seeing. I like her, I am open with her, she understands my past. She is sick though and getting better. She is living in south africa with her family. I only see her for 2 weeks. I return start university. I work my ass off and focus. I get an internship. I work hard, I struggle, I am sad every day. I am 26,My mother had gone through my bank stuff and found I has bought a vibrator. We fight, yells and tells me how much of disgrace I am. I have a ring I had bought for the woman I had been seeing. She is sick and can't move to canada so I want to marry her. That find sends me backwards. I had to tried to tell me parent a million times how I feel and the fact i gay, she keeps bringing up marriage to men. If she find a purchase so horrible how will she react to me marrying a woman. I tell my girlfriend how I am feeling, she tells me not to worry and do it at my pace and take my time. She tells me she is okay, she will wait as long as it takes. I see her again for 2 weeks, I love her and her family loves me. Seeing them makes me feel like I am so alone. I feel lonely most days but i am very aware now. 

I am sitting here today watching everyone post a recap of their decade showing their accomplishments and here is am.not even halfway through my degree, lonely and scared, uncomfortable in my skin. Unsure of how to come out how to find a balance between the guilt I feel for not being a good daughter or staying in hiding and forever losing the person I love if not today then someday. I am sitting here in tears wondering when things got so messy, when I became so alone, when no one remembers my birthday, no one wishes me for holidays. Where my depression is now crippled with anxiety and I am fatter and unhealthier than I have ever been. 

Okay it is too long I will stop now!",moderate

She makes me feel like everything's my fault. All she talks about is me to her friends, ""oh my son is this and he is like that"". Mum expects me to do as she please like im her driver or slave and i hate it. Ever since ive been looking for a place to call home because now. My home isnt home anymore. All i feel when i fet home is despair, hate and angry. I wake everyday with a will to die. As years go by i lost myself. I wish i was 9 again ,because back  then i was as happy as i could ever be.

10,"My mum died two days ago, my heart is hurting so bad : I feel like I will never stop crying and feeling teary. My heart feels so sad for my Mum who won't get to do the things she loved anymore. She'll never get to feel the warmth again and get a really dark tan like she always did. It destroys me that her death could have been possibly prevented if she had been treated sooner. She was only 54, she should still be here. 

I'm torturing myself thinking of all the stupid times that I didn't act the way I should have just because I was too depressed. Or the things I didn't do that she asked me too or hinted/suggested. I had the ability to make her happy and I didnt. I upset her just because of my negative mind and how effected she was by me. All the lost moments where I was in the room but my mind wasn't present in the slightest.

She was suffering for a long time with alcoholism and unfortunately cancer took over her body. I feel like more could have been done to stop her from dying, I feel like I should have done more and been more helpful with her physical and mental health. I should have realised she was so unwell in the weeks before her death, there were days when I would look at her and just think oh god you look so unwell, why did I not say something? She might still be here if she had got to the hospital earlier. 

My heart hurts thinking about whether she was scared or worried. Whether she knew she was dying or had accepted her fate. Whether she knew she was leaving us and how distraught we were. When she was awake but delirious I couldn't look at her without crying, she must've known something was wrong because she almost never saw me cry. It brings me some peace to know she can't think and can't hurt anymore, her mind is resting and she is free from the pain of life.

I honestly don't know how i'll get over this, I realise only now that she was such an important factor in my life, I depended on her and she depended on me. I should've been there for her.",moderate
11,"😐 : i feel like im locked in myself, anger and rage making every day unbearable. not to be psychotic or anything, but i would very much like to murder all my loved ones indiscriminately.  the moral side of me (the coward) says no, stops me from doing any harm to others and myself, but everytime one mentions any sort of negative feelings and those suicidal thoughts, i want to kill them. let me do it for them. let me fucking bash your head in you little shit i cant bear to see you suffer like this. i could easily kill myself, but the survivalist wont let me. the need to see these people flourish despite theur difficulties is what prevents me from doing. contradictory to this, i would very much like to get rid of then along with every single human being on this planet. i want to be alone. i want to be unique. i want to ravage this earth on my own and live the beastly horrid life i deserve to live. kill me like a wild animal.

12,"It finally got the best of me : I have been struggling for a few years now, through therapy, talking to people, going out and trying my best to keep myself busy, enjoy life through all that it gave me.

But no matter what i did, or what i do, that excruciating pain in my chest never goes away. It's a combination of fear of wasted potential, not feeling like i am good enough, loneliness, anxiety and not being able to fit in all at once.

And it slowly took everything away from me. My passions and hobbies slowly turned into chores, i couldnt pretend to be happy enough in front of my friends, and they tried to help me, but it was pointless, so we slowly turned into strangers. Relationships crumbled, as i tried to find in others what was missing inside me.

And even though i am young and still could see and experience so many things, nothing seems to spark interest.

My grandmother almost died again. I spent Christmas alone. My ex got a new girlfriend, and I don't care much about that, but more about the fact that as a friend, I apparently no longer exist to him. I feel as though my family and friends are all so unreachable and nobody seems to understand when I tell them.

In 2019 the company I work for has gone through a big transition from small company to bigger player in the field. A few of our senior workers didn’t like the change so I’ve stepped up (by my own choice, my bosses are actually fantastic and would never ask) and worked longer hours and weekends to keep everything going. I’m up for a huge promotion next year because of it.


Towards the end of the year I noticed I was getting more tired and snappy so I booked a long break over Christmas where we’d normally shut down, assuming it was exhaustion. Now I’m off I feel like it’s gotten worse. 


Spending time with people annoys me, I don’t find joy in anything I do. I literally sleep and watch videos all day. I haven’t left the house or showered for a week because I haven’t needed to. I assume that everyone hates me because I am so dull.


I thought the break would refresh me but I was just using work to cover up what I assume to be a deep depression. Looking back the reason I put so many hours in is because I didn’t want to have to deal with my life at all, I wanted excuses to not socialise.


I feel like a shell of a human, more robotic than anything else. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I don’t know what I’m going to do.

The local late night pizza place gave me my order for free because they see me there all the time... While I appreciate it of course, when I got back home I just lost it.. like I never have before, I guess it was just the finality of new years coming to pass and the only person who gave a shit about me, who even had some genuine care about me was the guy at the pizza place.

I went to my fiancees house to visit with his mom and dad for a few hours. I told my mom I would be home by 8. I talked to her on the phone while I was there and told her more like 730. Honestly I had forgotten about that and left at 8. Before I even got out of the cul-de-sac she's blasting my phone with a call, yelling at me, "" where are you it's after 8!"" While it is literally 8:03 mind you. When we get to my house I break down crying. She tells me the usual. I'm sorry, I love you, I didn't mean to make you cry."" I try to explain that just because you stab someone doesn't mean you want them dead. It's the same logic. She says then that what about the times when I do things to her and she has to accept my apologies? Like, I'm your fucking daughter, wtf.

38,"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate

41,"Depression or laziness? : For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 
Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.
Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time.

Life is great and a terrible burden and everyday I have to find a moment to get my breathe and find up again. I like gravitate to all the terribly depressing songs that let me appreciate the beauty of art so many people have bestowed in their own way whether music or art or just words. Anyways man, it's a good, and terrible feeling knowing so many other people are feeling it too. It makes me wanna surface and bring some sad soul with me for a second, hit that parting glance of like, best of luck, and dive under again. I'm glad I've been gifted with this curse of caring enough for it to affect me and I just wanted to let whomever know thanks for suffering a little with me. Hope your moment is a little better and whatever and wherever you end up, know I cared if only for a moment. Thanks.",not depression
46,Making the choice : Sometimes depression really is just a big game and it is all about mentality. It is so hard to make the decision to not give up and to not talk down to yourself. Sometimes i make the choice that I am going to start taking care of myself because I deserve to feel good an healthy but it is so hard to stay in that mindset and so easy to stay unmotivated and just want to fall deeper and deeper into depression. Sometimes I decide i’m not going to care about trying to be happy and I am going to push everyone away to protect myself and because my mind likes to tell me no one cares when people really do. I decide i am not going to talk to anyone and should just accept my suffering and bask in it. It is so easy to not want to do anything to feel better but there is other options and it begins with making the choice to care about myself,not depression
47,"Weird depression. : Does anybody else have these weird periods of time when you feel confident, like you could do anything. Feel productive and are productive, even happy and more sociable than ever. 

And then It just goes downhill from there and you start to feel like you're going to cry, so you spend most of the day trying not to cry (specially when there are people around). All the things you did seem meaningless, so you just kind of stop trying.

At first I thought it was because I had commitment issues or I was too lazy. But now I don't know anymore, it has been like this for about a year and a half. It like being in a roller-coaster.

I have many blessings in my life - my health, my family, my loving partner, a great education, a great job, financial resources, a lot of wonderful things...but I'm still depressed on a day-to-day basis and I feel terribly guilty about it. Based on all of these blessings, I should be very happy and content, but I'm not. I am melancholy at times, agitated, irritable and unpleasant. 
I have scrupulosity OCD, which is essentially an overly active moral compass and makes me empathize and feel compassion very deeply. It also comes with a lot of guilt. If I see a homeless person or someone less privileged, I often think, ""that should be me"" or "" maybe God should give me something to REALLY cry about. and then I'll learn to appreciate my life.""
