I'm a burden to my friends and my family and now the only person I ever trusted to talk to about how I'm doing wants nothing to do with me anymore. I'm completely alone, worthless, and hopeless. I don't think I'll be able to make it through this year and no I won't see a therapist, I don't trust therapy and I never have, it's a waste of money. Mental health is not worth that much to me. Deep down I wish someone would commit an act of violence wherever I am at a given time and would kill me so I could spare my family knowing I'd killed myself. It's over, I have nothing.

i'm kind of just tired of lying to myself. of forcing my brain to find shit to look forward to, anything to look forward to, to try to keep depression at bay.  but everything i look forward to eventually comes and passes. and it never feels as good as i told my brain it would. nothing is ever good. nothing ever feels good enough to make me happy. it's all just more things to go through. with more people. more drama to be around. more things to be anxious about. 

everything's a cloud of fucking depression and it has been since 2013. my teenage years are almost over and i can honestly say they've all been absolute fucking shit and hell. 

i'm never good enough and i know from here on out people will just expect more and more out of me. more work. maintain my 4.0. an actual job, and internships, and volunteering, shit i can't fucking do. 

i don't know. i don't know. i'm sitting here crying and i'm completely fucking alone and i feel all the tears in the back of my throat and i don't know how much longer i can lie to myself about things to look forward to that are all fake and fake happiness anyway. i can't do it again i can't keep this up.

4,"Worst decade so far m16 : This whole decade has been so fucked for me, my sister died right before her 6th birthday and my mom died just in 2017 and she was just 40. Both from cancer and I feel like I’m dealing with this cancerous shit ever since. I never really had time with my dad when I was a child since he would always be on business trips etc, but since my mom died it’s just been me and him. 

He has good intentions but I just see him as a burden and I can’t wait until I go to uni. Most nights I go to sleeping hoping that I won’t wake up, I can’t kill myself because I’m to pussy to even do it. I’m just hoping one day maybe I’ll get lucky and have a painless quick death. 

I used to be bullied and had no friends, but even now with a decent social life and parties etc, I still feel like shit. Everyday I have just been getting high, but for Christmas break my dad took me to Florida for vacation and I haven’t had access to even shit like cigarettes,( fuck USA they legit changed tobacco to 21 the day I had to get cigs) and withdrawl have just been making me feel worse

I got pissed at my dad taking me on vacation and he started lecturing about me on all the shit he had to go though which I understand, I understand I’m a fuck up for being in a privileged “family” and hating to go on vacation just because I can’t get high everyday.

8,"I don't pray : I grew up in a very christian household, we had good times for a while but then when it got bad it got bad. There was emotional and verbal abuses, alcoholism and plenty of other grievances to fall back onto to blame for my mental health in life after. But through all that my mother was there, she supported me and cared for me when I couldn't or didn't know how, she would call me her rock because I kept her happy calm and stable.

But as time has gone on I've realized she was much more mine than I hers. I've struggled with depression since I was 6 years old and thoughts of suicide since 11, I'm 28 now and through all these years my mom has been there for me.

This last year I got my heart broken, lost pets, my job but she was always there for me throughout. Ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay, that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right.

I wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren, buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden. I wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but I failed that.

I took my time, telling myself there was plenty and I'd do it all some day.

My mom died three weeks ago. There was no hints or build up, she was healthy one day and then I woke up into a dream I couldn't fall asleep in. My family is small, group of friends even smaller. As the days passed I took note of how many left my sphere, close friends I was there for are nowhere to be found.

I lost religion a long time ago, I don't pray. But I prayed in that hospital, the hours waiting outside during surgery. I promised I'd be better, I promised I'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days. I cried and begged and pleaded.

And it all went unanswered. I felt like a fool, she would have never wanted me on my knees like that but I had to try and try I did.

Long story that i’m attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he’s in hospice, slowly declining every day. It’s caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn’t been driving. Because of that, i’ve had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can’t take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i’m just watching him slowly die. It’s taking such a fucking toll on my mental health.

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state.

26,"I don't want to rely on my partner to get me out of my downward spirals : 2019 helped me get to a place where I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. This is after around 15 years of random behaviour such as break downs, outbursts, relationships ending because I never felt good enough, confusion of why my behaviour was so up and down etc. Leaving home so young I always took care of myself and others, and that was all I had really - this empathetic, 'over kindness' so that I knew I was good at something.

I have a wonderful relationship now however am concerned my partner is the one to help me get out of my spirals. When I spiral I'm suicidal and get scared it's him that helps me crawl out of them. The next day I'm fine but then the guilt sets in at what he's had to watch me overcome and spend his effort on in helping me.

28,"One of my best friends committed suicide a few months back. Starting to think he had the right idea. : So about a month ago I found out that one of my oldest and dearest friends died way back in August. It took weeks after learning about his death from his family (from whom he was estranged, and who in turn waited months to tell any of his friends that he had died in the first place) to finally find out that it was indeed suicide, which many of us suspected was the cause. We all knew each other from working at summer camp together, indeed this guy was my counselor and mentor before he was a friend and an equal, and we all live all over the place so we often go months without seeing or talking with each other. Hence why none of us found out for months.

But that’s not exactly what I want to talk about here. I’ve been struggling with depression, often manageable but at times quite debilitating, for basically my whole life, certainly my whole “adult” life, and really since at least age 11 or so (for the record, I’m 26 now). I’m so incredibly fortunate to have family and social circles (small, but there) who are at least sympathetic and to have had access to therapy and medication for many years. And while it’s hard to say I’ve ever thrived living with depression, I have had some successes in my life: I finished high school and university with good grades, I’ve made some really great friends, I’ve done some writing which I’m actually halfway proud of, I’ve had one really great romantic relationship for two years - and when that relationship ended a little over a year ago, it ended on good terms and my ex and I are still friends. And, least or perhaps most of all, I’m still alive. I’m still here. 

But this last point at least is starting to feel less like an achievement and more like a weakness.

I’ve never believed suicide was “the cowards way out,” nor have I ever understood why people often react with anger towards a loved one who commits suicide. Or maybe I should say, I understand, but I don’t sympathize with that point of view. My sympathy has only ever laid with those who kill themselves, and when I found out about my friend this was my reaction as well; now that the shock has worn off, I feel nothing but sympathy, and a hope that his pain is truly over now.

I’ve also for a long time now held some fairly dark and fatalistic views about life in general, which I realize is almost certainly heightened if not directly the result of my depression, but my thoughts about this still resonate. That we are all doomed to die, and anything we experience in terms of achievements and happiness are fleeting, that in the end we will all be forgotten by the nothingness of infinite time. And further, that even the easiest and happiest life is filled with suffering. Maybe even that life itself is a bad thing, defined by suffering and sustained by an impossible desire to make it last as long as possible.

Yes, I know. I know how doom and gloom this all sounds, that it very clearly emanates from depression and sounds a bit like an angsty teenager’s pseudo-philosophical diary scribbles. And it’s also worth noting that this year, the last couple of years really, has been really pretty rough. I can’t hold down a job, my girlfriend and I broke up, I moved back in with my parents, and I can see all of my old friendships slowly withering. God, how much I want to have a beer with a friend and have it not feel like I’m being done a favor out of pity. God, how I want to have my hand held in an intimate gesture, I miss it all so much. 

And of course, all of this is hitting me particularly hard on New Year’s Day. Doubt that’s a coincidence.

40,"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do.

It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even.

41,"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head.

42,Im feeling down : I’ve struggled with depression in the past and I’ve thought that (with the help of therapists) that I’ve gotten better with it.

45,"Forgetting past days with past selves when engulfed by depression and dark times.. Realizing this might just help me : Before depression takes full control and has my head filled with only negative and sad thoughts, there  is this stage in which you are free to be edgy, to be the emo and someone who has the energy to even analyze the oncoming depressing thoughts, to compare future and past, to get confused. But when the negative and numb thinking becomes the habit that we almost willingly turn it into, we simply let go of what we were and what made us who we are, before depression transcend in our lives. As if we welcome the new sadly comforting depressed life, and discard the old busy life. As for me, this is one of the most surprising yet chiling realizations  I've had when having the deep talk with the psychologists or friends. I could only react bewildered when people make you remember who you are. ""You got some of them dark jokes"" ""somthing you probably can help me with etc"".   
I guess the pros of socializing when depressed, is that it kicks you back into place.  
So when I'm depressed i will try to remember who i was, yesterday, a week or a month ago- Despite the self hatred and despair. In that way, it might just help me. I sound like a therapist talking to a depressed 13 yo, i know. But i sorta hope this is uplifting.  
But I wanna add the fact that I'm 18, and I've had depression 3 times in my life. And maybe I have yet to discover what real depression is, or haven't lived long enough to actually state this as matter of fact",severe

A career, a degree, true love, *something.* Instead, I'm in the same place I was back then, except my youth is officially over. I'm turning 30 this year. Everyone my age is settling down and staying inside. Soon, my body will give out on me too. I used to be a fat kid, but I've gotten a lot more active in the past couple years. What's the point if I'm just going to start slowing down in a few years anyway? I'm finally serious about going to college, but the only way I can afford it is if I abuse the shit out of myself. I work 12+ hour days between work and school, and since I'm a freshman, I don't even see any reward for my effort except getting 1/400 closer to the cost of my degree every week (if I'm lucky.) Even my personal taste is becoming ""old people."" According to posts from r/starterpacks and elsewhere, things I like such as indie music, craft beer and tattoos are apparently ""insufferable pretentious yuppie boomer millennial shit"" now.

Then there’s the negative opinion of just using these mediums to escape reality. Which side do you agree with?

53,"My meds aren’t making my depression any better as of late. I don’t know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I’m afraid I’ve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don’t have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

59,"How long do Mirtazapine side effects last? : [Throwaway account because my gf follows me]
My partner has just come off 2 months of 30mg mirtazapine for depression and anxiety, due to it not really helping, and because of the frustrating (mainly sexual) side effects (the usual, but far worse than other meds) that appeared as soon as she started taking it. 
This has obviously sucked for both of us, our sex life is nonexistent recently. Luckily we’re very open when it comes to things like this, so it didn’t cause any tension or frustration. 
I’m on sertraline and have been on other antidepressants, so I can empathise with what she’s feeling, but I’ve never been on mirtazapine, so my question to anyone with experience with this medication is:
Assuming you experienced similar problems, how long did it take for your sex drive to return, and were there any long term issues?
Thanks in advance",severe
