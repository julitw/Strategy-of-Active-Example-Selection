4,"Title: if shaq and kobe fought who would?, Content: , Answer: As in a basketball match up or a fistfight?  If we are talking about a basketball one-on-one match up, then I believe that a healthy Kobe Bryant would be able to take on a healthy Shaquille O'Neal any day due to his superior outside shooting and ability to get by his man for a drive to the basket.\n\nHowever, this does not take anything away from Shaquille--who is a great player in his own right.  I pretty sure he would dominate Kobe if he were to back him down to the basket for a dunk.\n\nIn the end, I just think that Kobe would score more.\n\nNow if we were talking about a fist fight, then hands down, the winner would be Shaquille because of his built and size.  I'm sure that if he were to land a punch on Kobe, he would be feeling that one till next year.\n\nHope this helps.",Sports

17,"Title: Why do some people have more love in their heart than others?, Content: , Answer: To give love you have to know how to replenish it within yourself so there is always something to give away. If you practice a religious faith, many of the teachings are about a loving God who is the source of all love. Rules aside, most religious people feel like, since they are loved by God, and since so is everyone else, they should love others too, and they find it somewhat easier to do. Most folks who believe in God consider it, among other things, to be an endless well of goodness to draw from.\n\nAlso a good healthy dose of self-esteem. If you don't love yourself, you can't truly love someone else. And if you don't treat yourself well, who else will? People who have a lot of love in their hearts also show love to themselves.\n\nOf course, it has to do with how you were raised and if anything happened to punish you for loving others or if you lost trust or got hurt really bad in the process of giving love to others. It can harden you. \n\nBut don't confuse affection or endearments with love. There are lots of ways a person can love another and they aren't always easy or pleasant. Love is hard work sometimes, not always being nice. So if you think a person doesn't have love in their heart, they probably do, they probably show it in different ways, or it is hidden.",Business & Finance

The search engine allows one to ask for content meeting specific criteria (typically those containing a given word or phrase) and retrieves a list of items that match those criteria. This list is often sorted with respect to some measure of relevance of the results. Search engines use regularly updated indexes to operate quickly and efficiently. Without further qualification, search engine usually refers to a Web search engine, which searches for information on the public Web. Other kinds of search engine are enterprise search engines, which search on intranets, personal search engines, which search individual personal computers, and mobile search engines. Different selection and relevance criteria may apply in different environments, or for different uses.\n\nSome search engines also mine data available in newsgroups, large databases, or open directories like DMOZ.org. Unlike Web directories, which are maintained by human editors, search engines operate algorithmically. Most websites which call themselves search engines are actually front ends to search engines owned by other companies",Computers & Internet
