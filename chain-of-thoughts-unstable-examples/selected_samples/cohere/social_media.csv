8,"27M all my friends, peers are moving with their lives, i feel like i'm stuck in a rut going nowhere. : **I'm a 27M , no job no gf zero friends, no social life, totally loser,** i have tried everything to get a job, get a gf but getting rejecting from both, therefore i have no social life, no friends no money and no reason to go outside the house, while all my friends getting promotions, getting beautiful girlfriends and cars, all i have to do is stay in my room and scroll facebook and instagram, which makes me more depressing. They all have great lives while i have zero social life, and they go along with their age, right things at right age, while i have no clue why nothing works for me. Today is 2020 January 1st, first day of the decade, and i woke up with zero notifications zero new year wishes tho i stay on social media 24\*7. I'm at that point i dont hate my life now, im slowly hoping it would be end soon, as i can't bear this loneliness and hopelessness and defeat anymore. I'm not envy with others lives, but i don't know why nothing works for me. Just don't tell me go out and make it happen i have tried for both jobs and girls, getting rejected from every interview and not even get a dm back from any girl. And its eating me alive i'm running out of time... i know im lost, but i don't know why this shit happen only to me.  


i don't have any social skills to make friends or to get a gf. i'm not an interesting person, just a pale skinny guy with a feminine face, so the girls reject me at the first glance, i'm not very good with sports music and anything particular girls find attractive, all i do is sit in my room and watch movies. i'm tired of these things bothering me, im really love if my life end now, i mean i don't want to things get better or worse, i'm sick of this being a someone who is not good at any thing or not special to anyone",moderate

I start to think that there must be something wrong with them or they’re trying to use me in some way because how could someone with a sensible mind ever truly like me.

13,"Anyone else find that they are unable to cry? : I've been depressed for about fifteen years and when I think about it, I don't think I've cried for the last seven or so. It doesn't happen and I can't get it to. I feel like there's something wrong that this ability or natural reaction is gone for me. Maybe it would be helpful or cathartic to let things out, but I'm unable to get myself to cry. 

My depression mostly feels like nothingness instead of sadness, but there's a lot of sadness I think I need to feel to get over things, but it's like I can't make myself experience these emotions.

Is there any way to get back this ability or these feelings? I take medications and see a therapist and psychiatrist, but they haven't helped in enabling me to experience emotions or be able to cry.",moderate
14,"I hate myself so much that it spreads around me at times : Hi,

Before I begin, I am sorry for my language skills, it isn't my native tongue and I am not the best writer. This is the first time I express myself. I have nobody else but here.

  
In my country at schools retakes are once a year at the end of academic semesters where one retake can make you pass or fail the whole year. Until university I always slacked around and was practicing programming. At the end of each academic year I would attend all retakes and pass with C or above. However, we had those meetings where teachers would give feedback about us to our parents. And teachers always said ""Kuzenet is very kind and quiet. He is a nice boy, maybe the nicest in the class but he doesn't study at all."" These words would render my mother super angry. Every time she is back from those meetings I would get yelled at and my mother would cry every time. I am very sensitive and it was very damaging for me. Not to mention i did get beaten up a couple of times due to my mother's anger. My father would make his grumpy face - i would rather prefer someone torturing me instead of seeing him like that for months. He would never talk to me with a happy and welcoming tone. I could tell he wants me to go away as soon as possible his sentence is over from his tone. By the time my parents get better, another meeting would happen and all would reset. This loop begun in primary school until the end of high school.  


The reason why I mention this is because, now I feel incredibly inferior although I got scholarship and a part time engineering job. I feel very stupid at work and at university as well. Especially because the fact that I started university a lot later than my peers. I have no friends, literally zero. People only text me when they need help with assignments or when they study for exams. People I helped gave me nice feedback all the time about how their grades improved thanks to my assistance and all. No friends from that either. I pick foods that don't damage your brain but I love chocolate and every time I eat chocolate I feel very guilty thinking the sugar will dampen my cognitive abilities once sugar levels go down. All I wanted was friends that I can listen to, text with, read their messages. My phone doesn't function well for the past year and I didn't get a new one because there is no use for it in my life.  


I read a lot of suggestions online about going to rock climbing or something like that, but I am not into that and besides, I am living abroad. It is really hard to make any friends when you are a foreigner even if you are a fit in their culture just because you don't know the language that well. There is also the fact that some people don't like the country I came there from. They have assumptions about people from there and they avoid me at first. I do not put in the effort of proving them I am worth their time because I also don't think I am a great person either. I am only good at solving problems when people have one. Other than that, I don't know what to do.  


This consistent anger at myself being stupid and incompetent makes me short tempered at my parents. When I visit them I get easily annoyed. Today I made my father upset, I am very afraid of losing my parents as I think as people age they can't endure sadness or stress well and each time they are upset, I get 10x more depressed at least. My hatred towards myself is just adding up. This ends up being a infinite loop.  


I remember I was a very happy kid but nowadays nothing makes me happy. This has been going on for about 8 years. Everything is black and white. I attract no-one, I don't look into mirror for the past 8 years and I overthink everything.  


I hate myself to the fullest and I can't forgive how many times I made my parents upset. I failed a business before starting university due to third-party conditions. It wasn't my fault but still, I am the one who caused a loss. While I am not considering suicide because I can't do that to my parents, I don't feel alive at all. I live to work, yet I fail at being successful.",moderate

I kinda don’t mind it tho, and actually really like making out but not really because of the kissing but because it’s intimate and hot and fun idk lol. ALSO I feel like I’m way behind with everyone my age not being ready for sex and all but I really think it’s connected to my mental health (me being mild/moderately depressed like 24/7 all the time everyday, mainly everything is somewhat dissatisfying, nothing completely fulfilling). Am I just not ready or is it me being inhibited bc of my mental health? Me not wanting to because no one’s ever made me orgasm except myself (and I’m not even sure I’ve done it before) and I definitely don’t orgasm most of the time that I masterbate which is also rare and I don’t try to explore much cz I’m depressed, lazy, only have desire to do it like 1-2 times a month. I feel like maybe I have a more difficult vag haven’t tried like any toys besides a tiny cheap bullet vibrator which did absolutely nothing for me, inside or on my clit. Am I just not ready for sex cz want it to be with someone meaningful (fulfilling) and that will make me feel ready as well as not being depressed so things will actually be satisfying? Or maybe I just have to learn how to actually get pleasure down there and then I’ll want to do more. Idk what’s normal and what’s not. Turned down sex (and blow jobs, no desire to do that or even TRY it at all) (not willing to try many new things cz of my depression) multiple times cz just no desire to really go for it, do it.",not depression
21,Death of my father : My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to.

I went to my fiancees house to visit with his mom and dad for a few hours. I told my mom I would be home by 8. I talked to her on the phone while I was there and told her more like 730. Honestly I had forgotten about that and left at 8. Before I even got out of the cul-de-sac she's blasting my phone with a call, yelling at me, "" where are you it's after 8!""

It's just that I definitely know I don't look good, and it feels like everyone else is smart enough to know it too, which makes me shrink into my chair even more.

On top of that, my sisters were getting attention from different people all week. Again, I know how ridiculous I must sound typing this as a *guy*.

I’ve also loved going into different skills and hobbies including cooking, drawing, instruments, and others. Then comes 2019, I just lose my ability to do everything. The people around me say that what I do is good, but that just isn’t true. They’re just being nice and can’t see that the numbers just don’t add up. I cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when I took a bite I honestly felt like breaking down just a little. It was so god awful that I told them I refuse to eat it. I got up and walked away. Didn’t eat dinner that night. I just wanna feel good at something. Anything. The one thing I thought, I had some sort of skill. Some sort of worth, was in games. I grew up with it, played years worth. So why do I suck so damn badly? Moba’s I just seem to never be able to do the right thing at the right time, constantly being flamed. FPS’s people constantly ask if I’m intentionally deranking. MMO’s I can’t even do the end game content because I just don’t have the items to do it, and I refuse to pay to win. I usually don’t let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can’t do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to.

I was not expecting much because she is the only person I really knew there and I am not very good with meeting new people. But surprisingly I was having fun and talked to a bunch of people and even started conversations (!!!). I guess the alcohol helped a bit... 

When I got home I was really proud of myself for going to the party and especially talking to people and not sitting in a corner quietly. The feeling of making progress gave me a little confidence boost.

Fast forward to now. When I think back I feel like I was putting on a mask so I look like I am a social and fun person. Thinking about those conversations really makes me cringe because now they feel so fake and pointless. Like I was just having them to have a smooth, non-awkward evening and staying in my ""party persona"". 

I get the same feeling when I think about times where I opened up to my 2 best friends about having mental problems. In those moments I really had the feeling that I am making progress and this will help me. And even though they listened to me now it just feels like being a burden and a cry-baby. I just scratched the surface with them and I feel like if I unpack the bigger things they feel like I am this over-sharing weirdo that just wants a shoulder to cry on.",moderate

43,"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression

I have had depression for a few years now (I've lost track) and always end up fooling my counselors and my family because I always feel like I have nothing to complain about because people always have it worse than me. I have a good life; roof over my head, family, not a lot of frends but what ever. And so now i dont have anybody to tell about this becaues i am afraid they will find out i am depressed so i kinda push them away. Also i dont even know who is reading this but i am sorry for porring my problems on you.

48,"Struggling : Hey everyone.

It's the New Year, and like a lot of people around here I'm really struggling. If everything goes well, I'll have 3 years sober. I guess without the alcohol and the drugs I'm just left with myself, and that is the problem.

Without the drugs and alcohol I just cannot seem to make the slightest effort to make meaningful relationships with people. I still go to meetings but even in a room full of people I can feel so alone. I don't have friends, no relationships the past few years, and now I guess I've isolated myself so much that I just don't know how to talk to people. I drive them away, and eventually, the contact will stop altogether. I don't know how I'll go through this year. I just hope I can make it to the three years in March. 

Thanks for reading. I don't expect people to really care, but I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

I hope everyone else has a better New Year than I did.",moderate
49,"I woke up crying from a dream this morning : This is the third time in 2 months I woke up crying. They were about me, having a best friend. We were hugging and laughing, you know, what close best friends do. I was happy. And then I woke up crying.

I'm not surprised I have dreams about having a friend, since I've never had one, and the fact I have dreams about it, proves that it's one of my deepest desires, but I don't to be reminded about it. It makes me sad. These dreams were happy and I always woke up crying.

I realized I want a best friend much more than I thought.",moderate
