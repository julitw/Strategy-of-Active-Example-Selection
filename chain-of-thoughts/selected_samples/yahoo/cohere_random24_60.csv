Business & Finance,"Title: we are paying mortgage on a empty house that is for sale is there a better solution?, Content: paying mortgage and renting an apt due to pending divoice is there a better way to handle this until the house is sold renting  is not an option, Answer: Time for getting past what caused the split and figure out how between the 2 of you to get the best value from the situation.\n\nFirst if you can, you need to lower your price.  \n\nNow use the kids ballpark divvy system.  Remember when you were a kid and had to share a candy bar with a friend.  One of you would break the candy bar in half and offer the choice to the other person as to which half they wanted.  Simple but fair and very effective.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is that you agree between yourselves that one of you will make an offer to move into the house until it sells and makes some sort of payment as rent.  Now that might be the whole payment or a partial payment, either way it should be better off than each of you paying half of the payment on a vacant house.  So the agreement is made and the offer is made, now the other person (not making the offer) has the choice of either moving back in or letting the offeror move back in.\n\nIf moving back in isn't an option for one or both of you get creative and work out some other sort of arrangement.\n\nGood luck"

Politics & Government,"Title: Court ruling...?, Content: I went to court to battle an uncooperative ex-wife over unpaid medical bills for my son. The judge ordered her to pay me the FULL balance. The bills are in collections but it get's very confusing because they are my sons bills, but under my name. The judge said we can take care of it any way I want meaning she can send me the check or send it directly to the collections agency. I want it sent directly to me so I can make sure it gets paid, she hadn't paid this bill for over 2 years, why would I trust her? Now she says to me to give her copies of the bills so she can review them. Is she too late for this? It's already court ordered for her to pay it. I have already done enough leg work getting balances and calling and fighting with collection agencies because she wouldn't cooperate. Do i have to provide her anything now that its court ordered and been through court? She is threatening a De novo hearing., Answer: She is in contempt of court.  At this point, its not her concern what the bills are and for how much.  She doesn't need to see them.  The court ordered her to pay them and that's all she needs to know.  I'd advise the court that she is in default and request another hearing."
Science & Mathematics,"Title: if dinosaurs descended from birds did they sing like birds?, Content: , Answer: Birds descended from dinosaurs (or at least from thecodont archosaurs closely related to the dinosaurs), not the other way around.\n\nAs far as singing like birds, only one Order of birds, the Passeriformes really sings.  Ostriches, penguins, chickens, hawks, owls, vultures, seagulls, albatross, ducks, boobies, flamingoes, etc. are not really known for their musical ability.\n\nSince the ability to sing is not ancestral to the bird lineage, it is unlikely that it is a trait that came from the dinosaurs.  \n\nThat's not to say that vocalizations didn't evolve separately in one or more dinosaur lineages, but it wouldn't have been homologous to the Passerine vocal ability."

Sports,"Title: if shaq and kobe fought who would?, Content: , Answer: As in a basketball match up or a fistfight?  If we are talking about a basketball one-on-one match up, then I believe that a healthy Kobe Bryant would be able to take on a healthy Shaquille O'Neal any day due to his superior outside shooting and ability to get by his man for a drive to the basket.\n\nHowever, this does not take anything away from Shaquille--who is a great player in his own right.  I pretty sure he would dominate Kobe if he were to back him down to the basket for a dunk.\n\nIn the end, I just think that Kobe would score more.\n\nNow if we were talking about a fist fight, then hands down, the winner would be Shaquille because of his built and size.  I'm sure that if he were to land a punch on Kobe, he would be feeling that one till next year.\n\nHope this helps."

There is a scam going on out there where people are preyed upon to ""take Payments"" for a company. The problem is that the ""payments"" that come in are bogus checks, stolen money orders, etc. They want you to deposit those funds into YOUR bank account (so that you will get charged with fraud, etc.- instead of them) and then do a wire transfer of the funds into their bank account. Save yourself the heartache- do NOT do it. It isn't a job- it's a scam."

Health,"Title: What are emos?, Content: Because I was just accused of being one., Answer: from the slang dictionary:\n\nGenre of softcore punk music that integrates unenthusiastic melodramatic 17 year olds who dont smile, high pitched overwrought lyrics and inaudible guitar rifts with tight wool sweaters, tighter jeans, itchy scarfs (even in the summer), ripped chucks with favorite bands signature, black square rimmed glasses, and ebony greasy unwashed hair that is required to cover at least 3/5 ths of the face at an angle.\n\n \n\nPunk music on estrogen. Often acoustic guitar with soft, high male vocals that dwell exessively on the singer's feelings, especially melancholy remembrances of past relationships/mistakes in life. A form of music that diverged from punk in the '80s, the name ""emo"" is derived from the emotive style of the lyrics and music. This genre has lately been marketed heavily by the music industry to teenagers with bands such as Dashboard Confessional and Taking Back Sunday, and has seen much commercial and mainstream success. The music has also spawned a subculture which conforms to certain conventions in dress such as tight sweatshirts, tight band T-shirts and horn-rim glasses. Adherents profess to exessively melancholy temperments. Males that adhere to the emo subculture are sometimes confused with metrosexuals; indeed the line between the two is somwhat blurred, though both groups claim to be intouch with their emotional side. The ephemeral and hackneyed nature of emo songwriting suggests that its audience will be restricted largely to teenagers. the genre suffers from a lack of credibility outside the aforementioned demographic group, much like current Nu Metal bands.\n\n \n\nAn entire subculture of people (usually angsty teens) with a fake personality. The concept of Emo is actually a vicious cycle that never ends, to the utter failing of humanity, and it goes something like this:\n\n1. Girls say they like ""sensitive guys"" (lie)\n2. Guy finds out, so he listens to faggy emo music and dresses like a dork so chicks will see that he is sensitive and not afraid to express himself (lie). He dyes his hair black, wraps himself in a stupid looking scarf, develops an eating disorder, and rants about how ""nobody understands"".\n3. Now an emo guy, he meets Emo chick and they start dating, talking about how their well-off suburban lifestyles are terrible and depressing (lie)\n4. Emo guy is just too much of a pussy. His penis is too small, he's too depressed to bathe, and has more mood swings than emo chick, and he doesn't even have a menstrual cycle. Emo chick dumps him, saying ""It's not you, it's me."" (lie) as she drives off with Wayne, the school jock and captain of the football team.\n5. Emo guy goes home and cries, proceeds to write a weak song and strum a single string on his acoustic guitar. Another emo chick sees how he is so in touch with his feelings, and the cycle continues.\n\nThis is the sad truth of the emo lifestyle/music, and now that I look at how pathetic it really is, maybe the emos DO have something to cry about!\n\nWhen she sees how sensitive and emo I have become, she'll definately go out with me!"

Add a radiating heat source like a heat lamp and heat the closed environment,  measure the inside of the environment and then turn off the light.  graph how long it takes for the environment to return to ambiant tempeture.  increase the CO2 concentration and try it again.   It might be too difficult, but it shows the scientific process.  and you should get some good graph points."
