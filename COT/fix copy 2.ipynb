Similarly, a very low rating (1) seems inappropriate as there's no strong negative sentiment expressed. The text doesn't convey enough information to suggest a strong opinion either way, making a rating of 2 (which often corresponds to somewhat negative or unimpressed sentiments) or 3 (neutral or mixed sentiments) more appropriate. Between these, a rating of 3 seems more fitting as it suggests a neutral or somewhat indifferent stance rather than a mildly negative one.\n",
