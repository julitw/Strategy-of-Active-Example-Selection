"Cringing over my own socializing attempts : A few weeks ago a friend invited me to her party. I was struggling to motivate myself and get out of bed but I had promised her I would come and eventually I got dressed.

I was not expecting much because she is the only person I really knew there and I am not very good with meeting new people. But surprisingly I was having fun and talked to a bunch of people and even started conversations (!!!). I guess the alcohol helped a bit... 

When I got home I was really proud of myself for going to the party and especially talking to people and not sitting in a corner quietly. The feeling of making progress gave me a little confidence boost.

Fast forward to now. When I think back I feel like I was putting on a mask so I look like I am a social and fun person. Thinking about those conversations really makes me cringe because now they feel so fake and pointless. Like I was just having them to have a smooth, non-awkward evening and staying in my ""party persona"". 

I get the same feeling when I think about times where I opened up to my 2 best friends about having mental problems. In those moments I really had the feeling that I am making progress and this will help me. And even though they listened to me now it just feels like being a burden and a cry-baby. I just scratched the surface with them and I feel like if I unpack the bigger things they feel like I am this over-sharing weirdo that just wants a shoulder to cry on.",moderate

"ive been contemplating taking my own life : and im posting this here because i know i dont have the nuts to go through with it. 
Im an eighteen year old who struggles with a circuit board of mental issues. 
life is so confusing and anxiety inducing
When i was little, i wanted to grow up to be an animator, i loved watching shows and drawing, i found most of my creative output came in drawing. 


Last week, my portfolio was rejected. 
I had spent months, almost a year on my portfolio. Drawing, scrapping, crying, tearing, repeat. 
I had taken a few months to gather money for college, and i havent had the heart to tell my mom i didnt get in. 
I havent told my mom things in a long time, and i lie to her about my mental health. The amount of times ive held a knife and contemplated just slitting my throat open or holding all my night medication and downing it in one go before going to sleep shocks me sometimes. 
Its almost a daily thing, an hourly thing. With every action i do i think of a way to off myself on the spot. 

And the only thing keeping me from doing it is the time i told my dad i was having suicidal thoughts, and he broke down crying saying he is afraid to come home one day from work to find his youngest daughter dead. 
And that he couldve been home to prevent it.

And when in 2013, when my cousins died in a plane crash, my mom was devastated, she wouldnt stop crying, my dad had to restrain her, and i just started crying because i was so confused. Those are her niece and nephew but what about her Daughter? 
I may not get along with my mom, but i still love her too much to put her through that pain. 
My dogs would be so confused, my cat would curl up on my bed wondering when id come back. 

My depression sucks ass, and i cry constantly, and i hate my life and my lifestyle. 
But i would never do anything about it.",moderate

"Is there anyone who can relate to my symptoms? : I have been diagnosed with depression and anixety for 9 years but I'm not even sure at this point that it's the correct diagnosis. None of my treatments have worked, SSRIs made me worse and SNRIs only fixed minor symptoms like mood. Therapy and CBT do not work. And I feel so alone because the more I try and reach out, or find information about what I'm going through online, the more I realise that I'm alone in this.
I cannot get out of bed, and barely eat. I have not lost motivation or ambition, but it's like I'm physically trapped in my body. My attention span and memory are terrible, I can barely remember what I did yesterday. I feel anxiety constantly, even when I'm doing nothing or trying to relax. I can't keep a routine or care for myself because I feel I cannot physically move anymore. I get hypersomnia and at worst I can sleep for up to 24 hours, but my average is usually about 12. My mind races and the only time I ever feel normal is when I manage to distract myself and literally forget about reality. And I get this really weird feeling that never disappears, it feels like a physical pain that's numb. Like, imagine your arm is numb and then you pinch it really hard. You can tell that your arm is having a sensation of pain, but without the actual pain being felt. It's like that for me everyday. I am just trapped in this bed slowly starving.
The only conditions I have ever managed to find that might explain this are catatonic depression and/or psychomotor retardation. But it is so hard for me to find information online about these, and my doctors and therapist do not discuss it with me much. I know I should really fight for them to discuss it with me but I'm so anxious when I get there that I let them walk over me.
Please, is there anyone out there who feels the same symptoms as I do? I just don't want to be alone, I want to strong and know that I can get better.",severe
"A New year a new me (long) : I have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last New Years, but I didn’t, the reason is I had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver, you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning. While still being at my worst at this point I made changes to improve myself, I lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times I took weed edibles etc. I did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss. I know I didn’t push myself to my full potential, I messed days up, and I mean that’s fine but I got off track and into a depressive state after those days, every New Years I reevaluate my life, to be or not to be, and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether I want to approach the next year at all. This year I’m cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where I push myself harder than I ever have to see if I can do it and whether there’s something out there worth it for me. I am going to give myself the best fighting chance I can. 

It’s easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it, and don’t get me wrong It’s hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head. 
But...I personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad. If we don’t fight what’s the fucking point right?

I read a post I think on here where they named their depression frank... I mean it’s also known as monkey brain. This has helped me quite a bit over the past year But yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank, say hi frank you can piss off now. Or swiper no swiping lol (Dora depressed lol) but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank. From there I like to torture frank, franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night. The way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domain(you). flex your arm right now, it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control, remember that, if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will (https://youtu.be/--j5sGlrqMk) you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him, and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank, cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive, if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing, rejuvenated and alive( if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart, shits a god damn drug to me,it hypes me the fuck up.) torture methods also include exercise, have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chest/neck, hell no. 

I am personally going to challenge many things I have already been doing and some I have been slacking on and new challenges.
My list includes; 
4:30 am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of 7 am, 
No masturbation for the whole year, its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit. You will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time. Anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year. 
cold showers
exercise/train hard with a program( up to you) and only 2 days off for recovery at max. Get light body weight/cardio on these days. 
half hour+of meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed. 
2 day bulking fasting routine(snake diet)(side note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts, I’ve lost over 100lbs on it, just do it, it will make your life so much easier and better. It changes your mindset, if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline, what’s stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort, which leads me to this post and my new years resolution)
Beyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion, dry year.
learn guitar and master 12 songs at least(singing too). 
Improve the workload I can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects. 
Get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so I’m not stressing out.
Naturally these habits will replace filler activities/bad habits/depressive habits like gaming/Netflix/getting high/staying in bed from 5pm to bedtime stuck in your head, for hours on end. I have pretty much cut all of these out, I need to work on YouTube a little still, I have already cut down my subscriptions to people I actually watch and enjoy and that might only be 2 to 3 videos a day I watch. Maybe one for you is social media addiction, I don’t use social, get off that shit, that ding notification dopamine hit you get, oh who texted me etc. What did this person post, why am I not getting likes on this post etc. Also if you post god damn everything you do online, there is nothing to talk about with another person for example. Ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them. 

I know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that, but this is where I call home for the past few years, I just wanted to share my guidelines I will follow for the year to decide it all. I know I am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post, Or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way. I’m tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if I just outthink frank that everything will be better, you can’t outthink feelings. it’s time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better. 

If anyone would like to join me this year on some challenges maybe we can have a thread dedicated to people who want to fight their depression to death. I’m tired of feeling and living this way and I’m sure I’m not the only one.",moderate

"Am I depressed? Need help. : Hello,

I’ve moved two years ago to a new country.

I was already feeling like shit the past months: apathy, getting drunk consecutively, feeling no energy, no belonging anywhere and not able to empathize and unable to sleep. Anger and revolt with myself and the ones around me...

I have a great girlfriend, a good job but I feel so bad about myself everyday, I actually started hating my self so much with no good reason.  Just want to be alone...Thought coming back home would help.

Coming back home for the holidays my house is a wreck: my grandmother just started to have Alzheimer’s (my birthday was actually the first day she didn’t recognized me), my father is totally depressed, my mother is also lost and I keep on passing the days alpathic with no action whatsoever, and for some reason I feel angry, revolted and aparhic...just to feel guilt afterwards ...I do t know how to react and I keep on being a jerk or at least feeling like one. I hate myself and I keep on feeling angry by the fact that I cannot properly react or act upon the shedding place my home and my mind has become...

I even thought about killing myself the past days but I think I really cannot...

Being away now for two years also provided me with a feeling of not belonging anywhere (I also left home and my hometown at 18 until 32)...so I really feel I cannot belong, I feel bad, feel ugly, feel sad, feel alone.

Am I becoming depressed and should I find some help? Or should I just try to do something about my atitude?

I always think about getting help but I am always afraid of the medication..I know it sounds ridiculous...

"How do you take care of someone with depression? : I have a friend that’s been diagnosed and she’s been really hard to deal with.  

She’s stubborn, sometimes she’s mean to me. I would worry about her all the time when she’s not with me and she’s having an episode because she would either run away from her house or cut. 

Sometimes when she’s not okay she’s mean to me. Not like “fuck you” mean but her way of just being sarcastic with all my genuine questions like “are you okay” or “im sorry If i said/did anythign wrong”. 

Often when she’s not okay when we’re face to face she doesn’t tell me what’s going on but I know something is wrong. Then she gets home and we’re texting. The second paragraph happens, then she starts saying how she doubts me and stuff like that. 

When she’s having really bad episodes during the night, I would pick her up from her house because again (she might cut or run away) and we would sleep in the car together. Sometimes when I take her back to her house, she would not go in, she would just sit in front of her house and I would have to literally beg her to go in. 

I have to deal with this every single day and everything I do is to make sure she’s okay and it’s REALLY taking a toll on my mental health. Its come to a point where I don’t even have a life anymore.

"i’m happy i cried today : This new years i did nothing, my friends went out without inviting me. i was okay at first to be quite honest, i didn’t feel like going out but as the night became longer i started feeling sad, which from going numb to sad is an overwhelming feeling for me. i haven’t cried in 5 months i think (i keep track because i like to see how little i do cry). 12 am has then passed and i get into my head and start thinking about everything and for once felt an emotion, i started crying... i loved it, i loved crying at that moment. it wasn’t much but i just sat on the bathroom floor and cried for a bit, a few suicidal thoughts while sitting there but i can’t. it’s interesting that i felt so happy that i cried, it felt as though i’ve released a tension in my head, they were alligator tears mixed with sobs but it felt good, although i feel like shit now and haven’t slept and hate my life, i feel calm.",moderate
"Is anyone awake? : Please help, I need a voice, it's a terrible night. My heart is so heavy. Help please.",severe
2020 suck : When your year rings in with you seeing your ex of 3 years kissing someone on a social media story... I broke up with her but still it feels absolutely terrible.,moderate
It's 2020 and I want to meet new people : I posted this in r/introvert and my Snapchat is kb_shaw324 and I was wondering if anyone would be interested if we started sharing Snapchats or other social media apps in the comments so maybe we could all have some to talk to that is like us? We could even create a group chat if that's something people would be interested in? Don't be afraid to tell me if this is the dumbest idea ever.,not depression
"“It will get better.” : It’s been a couple of years now, and things got worse.",severe
"I hope things get better for you. : This time of year is always a rough time. Always a reminder of the good times everyone else is having. It's not about them though, it is about you.  I hope that things get better for you.

I have made no resolution. My original intent was because I didn't want it to be another failure. But, I will continue to try to work at getting better.  I hope everyone here does the same. Baby steps.  Fuck everyone else. You should matter to you.
