"Im a time bomb : Im the stereotype for you know what. And to be honest it's not far off. I have a deep hatred for people, they made me this way. Meds ruined my fucking life... Pills are not a fucking cure-all, They dont know how to handle someone with mental Illnesses so they dope them up until they feel the poor bastard is under control. Therapists and psychiatrists are full of shit just some quacks. Im just gonna say it...Abilify ruined my fucking life it's probably the cause for everything.",severe
"My dog is gonna die pretty soon n it just seems like the cherry on top of shit : I’m crying as I type this. I loved this dog more than anyone . I can’t stop crying knowing she won’t be here. I moved away from her because she’s my moms ex boyfriends dog, but fuck man. I just am so depressed . I forgot how shit life is. Fuck this man. I can’t go any more years living with this fucking bulls hit. All good things in my life just die. I really need some words of encouragement please.",not depression
"I’m getting bad again : I’m posting here because I have no where else to go. I’ve been dealing with depression for the last six years of my life, and recently things had been looking okay. I was going to school and I got a job in the new year. But it’s getting overwhelming again. I’m getting to the point where I don’t want to go to school anymore. School is really hard for me because of my depression, adhd, and anxiety so to deal with it every day on top of work is exhausting, but I don’t have any other choice. To my family, as long as I keep going I’m okay in their book, but keeping going like this is tearing at me and I fear that I’m going to fall apart soon. I just want to get away from it all, I wish I could just escape. I don’t know what to do anymore.",severe
"Feeling useless : I’m not a very outspoken or opinionated person usually but if I have experience with something or know the answer to someone’s question I’ll speak up. Over and over though, I get shut down or just flat out ignored. It happens so often but for some reason it still hurts me. My opinion is not valued and any information I have is doubted by everyone. I feel dumb, unappreciated, useless, and depressed as a result. It’s taken 33 years but I think I finally have to just stay quiet and not attempt to help people anymore. That’s sad in itself. 
Does anyone else feel this way? Maybe I’m just overreacting.",not depression
"Feeling powerless/helpless : Sorry I just need to vent. My depression has been so bad lately I cant drown it out with activities, it's always eating away at the back of my mind.  I'm 24, jobless, and still living with my parents. I'm looking for jobs but none have called me back, and I feel like a failure when I realize most people my age have moved out and (mostly) have their shit together. I'm also terrified of driving which really limits my independence. I'm going to school and like to think I'm trying to better myself, but it seems like everything I do is all for nothing. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever been in a situation similar to mine? 
If you read this far, thank you  for your time. All this may not seem like a big deal but it has me feeling utterly powerless and worthless.",moderate

"I feel like my boyfriend would be better off without me. : I’m 30 f chronic depression and recently switched from Paxil to Wellbutrin 300mg. It’s been rough and this extends to my relationship. My s.o and I have been arguing and he says I am the problem, that I instigate then fights and I add fuel to the fire. I feel like  he’d be happier if I weren’t around and I don’t know how to deal",severe
"Meds check? : My doctor changed my medication to panazep 12.5 and etizolam. Today's the first day day I took this combo. Is this supposed to make me feel so drowsy through the day always or is it just because this is new?
Note- medication for anxiety, depression and insomnia. I will be interviewing shortly for jobs.",severe
"I hope things get better for you. : This time of year is always a rough time. Always a reminder of the good times everyone else is having. It's not about them though, it is about you.  I hope that things get better for you.

I have made no resolution. My original intent was because I didn't want it to be another failure. But, I will continue to try to work at getting better.  I hope everyone here does the same. Baby steps.  Fuck everyone else. You should matter to you.

Happy New Year from me to all that are suffering.  You are not alone!",not depression

"My friend makes me feel bad because i don't want to play video games with him : He got a new PC and some new games, he was really exited to finally play with me but i lost enjoyment in doing anything that was once enjoyable for me. I kept thinking of excuses but i thought it might be suspicious after some time, so i just texted him that i'm depressed and i don't have any motivation or interests in stuff that i once liked, he texted me back with ""that's ok, hope you feel better soon"" i was happy he understood but the next day he talked to my other friend that she should play with him and then he says in a mocking way ""because OP doesn't want to play with me"" he still does it and it makes me feel bad.",not depression

"How do you take care of someone with depression? : I have a friend that’s been diagnosed and she’s been really hard to deal with.  

She’s stubborn, sometimes she’s mean to me. I would worry about her all the time when she’s not with me and she’s having an episode because she would either run away from her house or cut. 

Sometimes when she’s not okay she’s mean to me. Not like “fuck you” mean but her way of just being sarcastic with all my genuine questions like “are you okay” or “im sorry If i said/did anythign wrong”. 

Often when she’s not okay when we’re face to face she doesn’t tell me what’s going on but I know something is wrong. Then she gets home and we’re texting. The second paragraph happens, then she starts saying how she doubts me and stuff like that. 

When she’s having really bad episodes during the night, I would pick her up from her house because again (she might cut or run away) and we would sleep in the car together. Sometimes when I take her back to her house, she would not go in, she would just sit in front of her house and I would have to literally beg her to go in. 

I have to deal with this every single day and everything I do is to make sure she’s okay and it’s REALLY taking a toll on my mental health. Its come to a point where I don’t even have a life anymore. 

I felt really shitty when I saw everyone being happy and making posts on new year where Im stuck here feeling shitty all the time.",moderate

"Parents, Indian parents... Help [20M] : So, my mom considers me a psycho and gives me the typical ""don't be sad, it's all in your mind"" talks every goddamn day.

It's been an year since I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety disorder.",severe
"ive been contemplating taking my own life : and im posting this here because i know i dont have the nuts to go through with it. 
Im an eighteen year old who struggles with a circuit board of mental issues. 
life is so confusing and anxiety inducing
When i was little, i wanted to grow up to be an animator, i loved watching shows and drawing, i found most of my creative output came in drawing. 


Last week, my portfolio was rejected. 
I had spent months, almost a year on my portfolio. Drawing, scrapping, crying, tearing, repeat. 
I had taken a few months to gather money for college, and i havent had the heart to tell my mom i didnt get in. 
I havent told my mom things in a long time, and i lie to her about my mental health. The amount of times ive held a knife and contemplated just slitting my throat open or holding all my night medication and downing it in one go before going to sleep shocks me sometimes. 
Its almost a daily thing, an hourly thing. With every action i do i think of a way to off myself on the spot. 

And the only thing keeping me from doing it is the time i told my dad i was having suicidal thoughts, and he broke down crying saying he is afraid to come home one day from work to find his youngest daughter dead. 
And that he couldve been home to prevent it.

And when in 2013, when my cousins died in a plane crash, my mom was devastated, she wouldnt stop crying, my dad had to restrain her, and i just started crying because i was so confused. Those are her niece and nephew but what about her Daughter? 
I may not get along with my mom, but i still love her too much to put her through that pain. 
My dogs would be so confused, my cat would curl up on my bed wondering when id come back. 

My depression sucks ass, and i cry constantly, and i hate my life and my lifestyle. 
But i would never do anything about it.",moderate
Does sertraline make you gain weight? : My doctor gave me a prescription for this today and as its the first anti depressant ive ever taken im a little cautious. Are there any symptoms that are common that I should be made aware of?

"Started Anti-depressants : Hello, 29f here. I have had anxiety and depression since a child. It's gotten really bad though lately and have been feeling suicidal (not going to act on it, I cant) but I knew it was time to seek help. I took my first dose of antidepressants apo-trazodone 50. Is anyone familiar with this drug. Did it help? Pros cons? Side effects. What is your experience with it? I do know what helps one person may not for another, just curious.",severe
"i’m happy i cried today : This new years i did nothing, my friends went out without inviting me. i was okay at first to be quite honest, i didn’t feel like going out but as the night became longer i started feeling sad, which from going numb to sad is an overwhelming feeling for me. i haven’t cried in 5 months i think (i keep track because i like to see how little i do cry). 12 am has then passed and i get into my head and start thinking about everything and for once felt an emotion, i started crying... i loved it, i loved crying at that moment. it wasn’t much but i just sat on the bathroom floor and cried for a bit, a few suicidal thoughts while sitting there but i can’t. it’s interesting that i felt so happy that i cried, it felt as though i’ve released a tension in my head, they were alligator tears mixed with sobs but it felt good, although i feel like shit now and haven’t slept and hate my life, i feel calm.",moderate

Just Cried While Watching [KUNG FU PANDA] At A Family Gathering because of the Nostalgia : [removed],not depression
The most happiest/funniest people are the people to worry about. : I was reading an article on line that said the most happiest/funniest people are the ones that are secretly depressed and they hid it from people around them. And that got me to thinking...that fits me so well. I look and sound happy when i am around people and my fiancee but when i am alone and in my own thoughts. The thoughts come out and  now i understand why robin williams and chester bennington did it.,not depression
Imma probably die from drugs this year.. : I’m a full blown drug addict. As I’m 20 years old and can’t stop using meth and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to stop unfortunately. I’ve been to rehab and sober houses and still didn’t work as I would rather trade my life for these drugs.,moderate
