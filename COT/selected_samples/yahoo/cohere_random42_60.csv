Bush is the crookedest mofo to have squatted in the whitehouse in years. He has allowed spying in the USA under the guise that he is trying to foil terrorism. His dad used to be the deputy director of the CIA. So he has and will to continue to do whatever he and his vp deputy dog want to do."
Science & Mathematics,"Title: why a wet area of any fabric or paper appear darker than the drier area?, Content: , Answer: Because the color of any object which does not emit light is really due to the effect of reflection, there are various ways in which color is ""generated"".\n\nThe color spectrum is Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.  Because the light emitted by the Sun is most intense in the Yellow part of the spectrum, we see Yellow as the brightest ""color"".  Go in any direction away from Yellow and we see darker and darker colors. \n\nWe see the color of an object as the summation of the light that is reflected by that object.  When a piece of cloth or paper is wet, it absorbs water which fills in the spaces between the fibers.  Water reflects mostly in the blue spectrum, so that adds to the total light which is reflected by the object.  This added blue light makes the total light appear ""darker"" to us since it ""drags"" the spectrum of refelcted light away from Yellow."
Education & Reference,"Title: How do i write a bibliography on the American red cross?, Content: In my class we kind of have to write a research paper. Mine is on the American Red Cross , part of this paper is to wite a bibliography. I can't remember what a bibliography is, i know how retarded, and how do i write one on the red cross., Answer: A bibliography is different from a Works Cited page.\n\nBibliography is a sampling of books on a particular topic, usually encompassing the major works in that literature and some contrasting opinions.\n\nWorks Cited is a listing of books, magazines, journals, etc., from which information is taken to write the paper.\n\nDepending on what type of writing style you are using (MLA, APA, Chicago, Turban), you will either write a Bibliography or a Works Cited page.\n\nIf a specific writing style hasn't been assigned, usually MLA or APA is accepted.\n\nIn general, a Bibliography is an alphabetical list (by last name of author) of all the works you've cited, referenced or utilized.\n\nThe authors name, with last name and a comma and initials, goes first.  Then the Title of the work (in quotes if it is an article, italicized if it is a periodical, underlined if it is a book) Example:\n\nKeynes, J. M.  <u>A General Theory of Interest and Wages.<u> London: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 1938.\n\nTobin, J.  ""Towards a More Economically Just Society."" <I>Econometrica<I> Vol. 47.

Health,"Title: Do you know the name of the ""hot"" yoga?, Content: There is a type of yoga that is held in a room with a high temperature (like 102 degrees). Do you know the name of that type of yoga?, Answer: I am a conscientious but nondenominational exerciser, and coming to Bikram (a.k.a. ""Hot"") Yoga began more as a scheduling convenience than devotion to its unvarying regimen of 26 poses (asanas), each performed twice and held for what can seem like forever over the course of the nearly two-hour class. \n\nYoga comes in almost as many guises as there are yoga instructors, but most classes build on the same basic foundation of poses performed sitting, standing and lying down. Although some, like the Sun Salutation, consist of a progression of steps, more often the goal is to work gradually toward a single ideal shape: the bow, the triangle, the cobra. My needs are simple: I want supervised, intensive stretching, and every yoga class I've ever attended offers at least that. \n\nThe truth is, I hated this Bikram class when I started. At first I returned only because I was desperate — the victim of a muscle-kinking bout of business travel (cramped airline seats and strange beds). Our teacher, Leah Weisman, seemed to talk incessantly. The room was always full, from 30 to 50 people. And the space was intentionally overheated. \n\nTrue Hot Yoga requires a room temperature as high as 105°F, supposedly so muscles warm up quickly and stretch more easily. This gym's drafty old studio achieves only Balmy Yoga — about 81°F — which is just as well. I've experienced optimal Bikram temperatures just once, and frankly, that's way too much bodily fluid shared and dripped and flicked around among a bunch of people who know one another in anything less than a biblical fashion. \n\nBut the thing I hated most about the class was that at the very end, while everyone was resting for a few minutes in the stillness of Shavasana, the corpse pose (designed to quiet the mind), Leah broke into song. Classroom scuttlebutt is that she has been known to sing On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever, but I've only heard her sing verses from New Age-y folk tunes that mention planets spinning around the sun and the Earth Mother calling her children home. \n\nWhy torture myself so? Simple: love triumphs over hate. As it turns out, Leah is an excellent teacher. Week after week she goes through the same routine without ever falling into autopilot. She is very ""present in the moment,"" as she might describe it. Leah offers cautions about overexertion, suggestions on how to do each pose at various levels of challenge, and great good humor. Last week she talked about a meditation seminar she had attended and called the impromptu lecture her ""sermon on the mat."" \n\nAs a gasping heater blows lukewarm air around the room, she intersperses practical instruction (""Pull up your quads as you pull down your hamstrings"") with abstract concepts (""Remember, you're burning new neurological pathways"") that I take or leave, depending on my mood. \n\nLeah wanders among the students, propelling the class forward even as she stops to adjust an arm angle here or perform a thyroid-massaging chin tuck there. She urges noncompetition, with oneself (""However you do the posture today is how you should do the posture"") and with others (""How can you compare yourself to your neighbor? You don't have the same body!""). Her monologue becomes a mantra, returning my oft-wandering focus back to the pose I'm attempting. Where is my center of balance? Can I feel my spine stretch if I imagine my head and tailbone pulling in opposite directions? How does my alignment shift when I turn my foot three degrees to the right? \n\nSome people criticize Bikram for being too arduous, but as with all yoga, much of the responsibility falls to the individual. I welcome this opportunity to eschew faster, higher and stronger in favor of deeper. In this regard, the simplicity of Bikram's poses is one more way to avoid being distracted from myself. \n\nTo spend this much time slowly and gently stretching is a luxu"

WHY do my muscles ache more on 2nd day after?, Content: my workout routine slipped for about 6 months.I am just getting backing into a routine and had a good session on saturday with a mixture of cardio, stretch, weights,cardio and stretch followed by a short stint in the sauna. I am covered in spots now. I had a few aches yesterday the day after but today monday my triceps are in agony.whats going on, Answer: Initially after a work out your brain will release endorphins as a pain reliever to help your body not feel pain as it heals, mostly during sleep. It also makes you feel very good.\n\nThat is why most typically feel better when they are in shape or getting there. \n\nIt only last certain periods of time, usually for a day or two. When it runs out (usually a day after a good workout) you will feel it. Your body is the same, but you feel it more two days later because the endorphins wear off.\n\nMake sure you stay hydrated constantly hours before, just before, during, just after, and hours after your work out. \n\nEAT A BANANA BEFORE YOUR WORKOUT!!!!\nThe potassium will give a very noticable boost, and help with cramps.\n\nEAT SOMETHING SALTY AFTER YOUR WORKOUT!!!!!!\nThe salt will trap water into your muscles that move in when your muscles stretch and keep it there, maintaining your swollen state.\n\nNEVER EVER DRINK CAFFEINE OR ALCOHOL AFTER!!!!\nThey sap water from you body and you will ruin your workout as if you never did it."

Why would people ruin beautiful things like poles, signs and buildings with those horrible stickers and paintings ?\n\nsorry, that was some lousy sarcasm...truth is: i actually agree. i even had a jesus-sticker on my mailbox once, took me 15 minutes to peel it off.

Health,"Title: whats the best exercise to do to get rid of a beer belly?, Content: , Answer: Hi, there, to lose weight, the best thing is to do cardiovascular exercises like biking, jogging, walking at a fast pace...You are supposed to do them on an empty stomach in the morning or in the evening. The reason why we do it on an empty stomach is bcos u dont hav any food in ur body that it needs fuel to get energy for u to do that exercise.. Then, your body resorts to burning the body fat as a fuel. Do cardio for 40-45 mins 6-7 times a week. But, note this that cardio takes 30% and diet takes 70%. So eat 4-5 small meals a day which contains low carbs, high quality protein ( lean read meat such as chicken breast, turky, tuna ) and some vegetables. By eating smaller meals more frequently the metabolism become fast. Of course, it must be healthy, not junk food. And avoid eating sugary food , sweets and the likes. Try to hav less stress ( just try to think that argument or whatever problem is not gonna kill u that you dont really hav to care much, for example). And try to get restful sleep around 7 hrs a day. SO, that is everything u hav to do. You will see the difference in 2-3 mths if u follow them strictly. \n\nBut, truth be told that alcohol , beer is very fattening  and it decreases ur testosterone level resulting in estrogen increase which encourage ur body to gather more and more fat. So, quit drinking beer. Good Luck !"

If you are talking about your allowance then you should be more concerned with helping out and doing your part than worrying about 83 cents. My guess is your parents want you to help out around the house to learn the value of work.\n\nPersonally, if a child of mine counted every penny and insisted on 83 cents for unloading the dishwasher they would find themselves doing a lot of unpaid chores for quite a while.\n\nIf on the other hand, you are talking about pay for hire like a part time job, labor laws vary state by state.

That particular year was notable because the National Hockey League (NHL) had a labour stoppage due to contract negotiations between the league and the players. Many professional hockey players who could not play in the NHL chose to play in Europe or in other North American leagues. The largest number of professional NHL players were in Sweden. This increased the quality of play dramatically and many observers said that the Elitserien was the best league in the world during 2004–2005, with Frölunda HC being the best team in the league.\n\nAlthough their home arena is the Scandinavium, when it is occupied by other events they play home games at Frölundaborg (capacity 9,200)\n\nFounded: 1944 \nHome arena: Scandinavium (capacity 12,044) \nSwedish Championships won: 3 (1965, 2003, 2005)"

Science & Mathematics,"Title: What are the benefits of using a permanent magnets for field excitation on a generator/turbine?, Content: , Answer: I have a small wind turbine which uses permanent magnets instead of a field coil.  The main benefit I can see is in keeping the electronics on the ground.  As the wind speed increases, the output voltage (and power) from the generator will increase as well.  I have a shunt regulator at the batteries to prevent overcharging.  Everything outside on the tower is very simple and less likely to break.  Other than mechanical breakdown, repairs to the system can usually be made on the ground level.\n\nOn a gasoline powered generator, sometimes permanent magnets are turned inside the AC output coils.  This eliminates the need for brushes and the voltage regulator board.  AC output coils have been designed to supply 120VAC at 3600RPM.  If the engine speed changes, the output voltage will change as well.  Output voltage will also change with load variations.\n\nI have more generator information online.\nhttp://members.rennlist.org/warren/genfaq.html\nhttp://members.rennlist.org/warren/generator.html"
