Health,"Title: I am getting back into a gym routine. WHY do my muscles ache more on 2nd day after?, Content: my workout routine slipped for about 6 months.I am just getting backing into a routine and had a good session on saturday with a mixture of cardio, stretch, weights,cardio and stretch followed by a short stint in the sauna. I am covered in spots now. I had a few aches yesterday the day after but today monday my triceps are in agony.whats going on, Answer: Initially after a work out your brain will release endorphins as a pain reliever to help your body not feel pain as it heals, mostly during sleep. It also makes you feel very good.\n\nThat is why most typically feel better when they are in shape or getting there. \n\nIt only last certain periods of time, usually for a day or two. When it runs out (usually a day after a good workout) you will feel it. Your body is the same, but you feel it more two days later because the endorphins wear off.\n\nMake sure you stay hydrated constantly hours before, just before, during, just after, and hours after your work out. \n\nEAT A BANANA BEFORE YOUR WORKOUT!!!!\nThe potassium will give a very noticable boost, and help with cramps.\n\nEAT SOMETHING SALTY AFTER YOUR WORKOUT!!!!!!\nThe salt will trap water into your muscles that move in when your muscles stretch and keep it there, maintaining your swollen state.\n\nNEVER EVER DRINK CAFFEINE OR ALCOHOL AFTER!!!!\nThey sap water from you body and you will ruin your workout as if you never did it."

Sports,"Title: tim sylvia?, Content: anyone else think that sylvia dosent posess half the ability he thinks he does.hes a less than average fighter who just happens to bo 6'8''. he over welmes people with his size. did you here him bragging about how he out ju jitsued jeff monson. i ant impressed. the guys a foot taller. in fact that fight turned myself into a monson fan. and if anything i really cant stand sylvia now. brandon veras a tough dude juast like monson was. but vera dosent stand a chance agains sylvia just for his size alone. he is way to cocky which is why i cant stand him. i know im not alone on this one. if i went arround fighting jr. high kids i would feel pritty bad ass to. and if a jr.high kid went the distance against me i sure as hell wouldent be bragging about it. i say bring on fedor. once he gets his fat ass handed to him from a true m.m.a. hevey weight then he will realise how huch he sucks. then i can only hope he will kill himself. yah i said it, tim sylvia should kill himself., Answer: I agree with a lot of what you said except three things:\n\n1st- Shut up and get in the ring before choosing to be completely disrespectful of the person who gets in the ring and has fought hard to get to the point where he is. No question about it; He did get the title. Tim Sylvia has heart and determination but not the natural ability. His time is growing short. \n\n\n2nd - Brandon Vera is easily the next heavyweight champion. Vera is the total package with speed, power, and unbelievable ground game and so versatile on his feet. Watch his fight with Fabiano Scherner. He switched leads and stances about every 4 seconds with incredible footwork. One of his coach's, Lloyd Irvin is one of the best in the training business.  \n\nHis recent defeats are all considered at the top of the division:\n Win Frank Mir TKO (Strikes) --- Former Heavyweight Champion\n Win Assuerio Silva Submission (Guillotine Choke)\n Win Justin Eilers KO (Kick and Knee)\n Win Fabiano Scherner TKO (Knees)\n Win Mike Whitehead TKO (Injury)\n\nand let's keep in mind that Vera is young. He is a bit cocky but still very respectful.\n\n3rd Please post-read your typing. People are friggin driving me crazy while we try and decipher others writings because of missed words, misspelled words, punctuation and capitalization. It takes the same about of time to do it correctly. Come on now. \n\nIt amazes me how lazy people are getting. To lazy to type correctly."

Society & Culture,"Title: Can the HOLY TRINITY be revealed in How we are Created in God's Image?, Content: God is spirit. He cannot be seen. If you were to examine all the creatures, the CREATOR has made a pattern emerges: angels and demons are intellectual creatures without a body; plants and animals do not have an intellect but a body and mortal soul. IT IS ONLY LIVING, HUMAN, BEINGS, that have a MIND, BODY, and SOUL. Only human beings have all three. Now, living, human, being is the existence of man. Those words describe the essence of man's mind, body, and soul. The Body is living, the Mind makes us human and distinguishing us from animals, and our Soul makes us the being that we become (good or evil).\n\nNow, even Muslims will agree Allah is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing), and omnipresent (ever present). These words describe the existence of God. So, what is the essence of God? I will hold off answering this question till the end., Answer: God the Father, mind\nGod the Son, body\nGod the Holy Spirit - soul\nHuman - made up of body, mind, and soul; therefore in the image of God - the Trinity"

I prefer a government run by true people who believe in their country and do it for all the right reason, instead of money and power.\n\nCommunism was the illusion of Utopia that failed because humans were running it.\n\nConservative wants to cut all aid to the poor, privatize social security AFTER they have completely pilfered the fund, and wage war on anyone that argues with them.\n\nLiberals are in it for the bleeding heart, but still want to raise their earnings and screw the private sector.\n\nNationalists are bigots, dictators, and culture purifiers that base their philosophies on conservative ""values"" and Ku Klux Klan ""ideals"".\n\nKill all politicians I say..."

Politics & Government,"Title: Are there any blogs or Web sites devoted to publicizing the corruption of lawyers? (It's not a joking matter.), Content: It is common knowledge -- and a totally unacceptable condition -- that lawyers are the most corrupt occupational group in this country.  That includes unfit-for-anything judges, bar associations, and ""disciplinary"" committees that absolve the very crooks they are supposed to be punishing.  \nAmong occupations that require a college degree, there isn't any\nother that even comes close to being as filthy.  Other groups that claim to be professions do strive persistently to improve their standards, but lawyers -- including those judges, bar associations, and committees -- have for decades and decades devoted themselves to the self-interest of lawyers with a total disdain for the public interest.\nThis represents a horrendous breach of the social contract which has given  lawyers a licensed monopoly in exchange for which they are supposed to SERVE the public interest, not stomp on it.
