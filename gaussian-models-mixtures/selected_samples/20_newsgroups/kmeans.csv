zechariah reads little differently lo king comes triumphant victorious humble riding ass ass colt command peace nations isnt much difference except zechariah involves one animal asscolt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthews version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier st mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt havent read mouth babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise likely matthew made response since jesus never one point little prophetic things since might expect quote error seems fit matthews track record quite well might ask jesus matthew havent read source reads psalms yahweh lord majestic name whole world whose glory chanted heavens babes infants founded bulwark foes still enemy avenger passages hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given gd messiah king jesus mentioned seems one case matthews pen making convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said lord jesus said asked promised jewish messiahking descended jews agree king david jesus counters quoting psalms lord said lord sit right hand put enemies feet taken face value jesus denying necessity davidic descent one assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiahking tempting believe one christian interested matters investigation problems jesuss time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better davids rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesuss time also made one must remember various factions among jews often result different expectations messiahking jesus apparently one adventists like audience thought messiahs advent imminent interpreted psalms among others messianic problem psalm literally reads yhvhs utterance lord sit right hand make enemies footstool yhvh sends forth mighty scepter zion rule midst foes people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order melchizedek forever word lord often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity lord hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord generic term would use used often scriptures refer kings gd merely address respect nothing text imply word refers either divinity messiahking supposed written david certain title psalm translates either psalm david psalm david seems fitting assume written court poet davids covenant endorsement gd psalm written david unlikely would talking messiah idea perfect king descended david present davids age extensive tales davids doings sayings none include praises messiah many psalms show evidence written long david dead times exile gd put show favour davids kingdom hold description psalm fit david well david promised gd rise power victory enemies successful judgement among nations conquered achieved priesthood common melchizedek righteous king enabled bless people fits blame problem matthew alone though artificial prophecy alluded though use scripture rather questionable still event common gospels let matthew little easily time interesting note though matthew dresses event earlier gospel mark tells tale jesus simply speaking crowd matthew pharisees became religious competition infant christianity target jesuss question might expect matthew writes event ends embarrassing pharisees power pen moses jesus together along leave gospel story matthew momentarily see pseudoprophecy johns gospel gospel story john deserves special treatment seems far removed real events jesuss career told even matthew moment look one verse early church leaders founded religion jewish hopes messiah king artificial extension original promises made gd constructing history abraham moses wrote promise land nationhood jewish people accomplished eventually rule king david christians came along later decided would claim fulfillment promise expanded promise preaching heavenly kingdom john jc speaking father abraham rejoiced see day say glad would nice tie approval jesus abraham abraham knew nothing jesus messiah anything christian tried failed find event old testament corresponds johns little prophecy par course see st john making old testament backings like forerunner matthew many christians know faith many foundations fraud surprising still cling potters field told jesus betrayed jerusalem one followers judas iscariot matthew writes mt throwing pieces silver temple judas departed chief priests taking silver said isnt lawful us put treasury since blood money bought potters field bury strangers fulfilled spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty pieces silver price price set sons israel gave potters field lord directed prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament scripture first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet zechariah utters verses matthew makes use zech weighed wages thirty shekels silver yhvh said cast treasury lordly price paid took thirty shekels silver cast treasury house yhvh first verses zechariah deal betrayer messiah gd deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly gd would send judah israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthews quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariahs context whereas potters field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthews track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judass situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests would put money treasury worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite course average thursdaynight bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthews work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified mt gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted would drink crucified divided garments among casting lots might fulfilled spoken prophet parted garments among upon vesture cast lots first vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine type roman soldiers drank regularly find right jesus dies soldiers give drink polluted gall jn jesus said thirst bowl vinegar stood put sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth received vinegar said finished matthew seems drawing passage prophets one psalms ps looked pity none comforters found none gave poison food lit put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink add punishment upon punishment may acquittal thee let blotted book living course sour wine offered jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks gd damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospels says lk jesus said father forgive dont know matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesuss drink meat psalm stipulates prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings nd psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesuss clothes divided told great thing turns happened often felon days soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesuss clothes man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions nd psalm psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemies becomes song praise yhvh hope taken context parts seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse god god forsaken far helping far words groaning oh god cry day dont answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like lamb led mute shearers indeed jesus doesnt much groaning even cross certainly cry day night cross worm man scorned men see mock make faces wag heads committed cause yhvh let deliver delights seems fit jesuss execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm many bulls encompass open mouths widely like ravening roaring lion yea dogs round company evildoers encircle pierced hands feet see bones divide garments among cast lost raiment yhvh far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion afflicted soul horns wild bull would seem quite convincing im sure early christian fathers wrote prophecy thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words pierced really exist psalm correct hebrew translation yea dogs round company evildoers encircles like lion hands feet hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion kaari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word kaaru add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translators chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty translators apart erroneous verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalms true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce hands palms rather forearms doesnt say much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples scars palms facts arent bound religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability time attempt draw many direct links psalm lord jesus psalm like many others minds gospel writers compiled stories interpretations jesuss life death much scriptures may contributed actually got written question serious repercussions christian theology easy see faithful fundamentalists events new testament might enhanced scribes eager matthew less speculate simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims far said good things st matthew reference piercing looks lot like jesuss crucifixion johns gospel recount written years fact tells us jesuss execution jn one soldiers pierced side spear came blood water things took place scripture fulfilled look theyve pierced course built passage taken blatantly context prophet zechariah tells us much nation israel split jerusalem judah go war zc yhvh give victory judah day seek destroy nations come jerusalem judah pour spirit compassion supplication jerusalem look pierced mourn weep bitterly like weep firstborn child johns attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker matthews attempts matthew least usually excontexts one passage johns errors grossly obvious blatant speak well gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded reckoned transgressors arrest jesus quickly executed claiming jewish kingship messiahship according one version gospel tale jesus gets executed along two thieves mk crucified two robbers one right one left scripture fulfilled says reckoned transgressors mark trying link jesus passage isaiah servant nation israel passage messiah one reads whole chapter isaiah surrounding chapters one sees servant nation verses also servant gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal also happens fit description jesus passage really messiah still clear executing jesus two thieves would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesus would fittingly fulfill whole ministry considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least case see mark could made better analogy general comparisons mark goes tell us crucified jesus also reviled expected couple robbers course later recount st luke decides change things luke tells us lk one criminals hanged railed arent messiah save us certainly fits marks recount tells people crucified jesus said save robbers luke goes criminal rebuked first saying dont fear gd since sentence condemnation indeed justly receiving due reward deeds man done nothing wrong said jesus remember come kingdom jesus answered verily say today paradise little dialogue seems highly contrived stretches imagination bit see picture one ruffian rebuking

strange demon special seems either true believer faith apparently enough faith allow someone move mountains course find one days move real mountains one parts seas miracles charismatics speak rumoured happen trips mexico faraway place major miracles making old womans arthritis feel better sunday morning tv gods including jesus always shrouded ancient lore writings protected skeptics sacred pasts either dead sleeping hiding heaven people rumouring imminent return great miracles days long gone yet life goes tales mystics stories miracles distant time distant place gods used reveal men old days jehovah silent theologians give various excuses dont get see god anymore lazy zealous enough sinful plan put many demands gds appearance right faith willing meet gd terms yet even pious men seen gd dear reader seen gd literally know true know thats presumptuous bold searching heart know mean weve seen religions make people feel good content seeing gd say little faith merit us see gd sometimes say see love people worship see lives people change seeing gd thus people get lulled sleep satisfied turning gd everyday sights seeing gd speaking seeing gd way people used see see world good compassion human hearts love given taken men women forgiveness practised christian atheist alike beauty created mind man things done see said everybody little faith jesus rides ass shortly accepting role jewish messiah king jesus requests donkey brought ride jerusalem mt took place fulfil spoken prophet saying tell daughter zion behold king coming humble mounted ass asscolt course passage quoted zechariah reads little differently lo king comes triumphant victorious humble riding ass ass colt command peace nations isnt much difference except zechariah involves one animal asscolt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthews version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier st mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt havent read mouth babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise likely matthew made response since jesus never one point little prophetic things since might expect quote error seems fit matthews track record quite well might ask jesus matthew havent read source reads psalms yahweh lord majestic name whole world whose glory chanted heavens babes infants founded bulwark foes still enemy avenger passages hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given gd messiah king jesus mentioned seems one case matthews pen making convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said lord jesus said asked promised jewish messiahking descended jews agree king david jesus counters quoting psalms lord said lord sit right hand put enemies feet taken face value jesus denying necessity davidic descent one assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiahking tempting believe one christian interested matters investigation problems jesuss time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better davids rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesuss time also made one must remember various factions among jews often result different expectations messiahking jesus apparently one adventists like audience thought messiahs advent imminent interpreted psalms among others messianic problem psalm literally reads yhvhs utterance lord sit right hand make enemies footstool yhvh sends forth mighty scepter zion rule midst foes people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order melchizedek forever word lord often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity lord hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord generic term would use used often scriptures refer kings gd merely address respect nothing text imply word refers either divinity messiahking supposed written david certain title psalm translates either psalm david psalm david seems fitting assume written court poet davids covenant endorsement gd psalm written david unlikely would talking messiah idea perfect king descended david present davids age extensive tales davids doings sayings none include praises messiah many psalms show evidence written long david dead times exile gd put show favour davids kingdom hold description psalm fit david well david promised gd rise power victory enemies successful judgement among nations conquered achieved priesthood common melchizedek righteous king enabled bless people fits blame problem matthew alone though artificial prophecy alluded though use scripture rather questionable still event common gospels let matthew little easily time interesting note though matthew dresses event earlier gospel mark tells tale jesus simply speaking crowd matthew pharisees became religious competition infant christianity target jesuss question might expect matthew writes event ends embarrassing pharisees power pen moses jesus together along leave gospel story matthew momentarily see pseudoprophecy johns gospel gospel story john deserves special treatment seems far removed real events jesuss career told even matthew moment look one verse early church leaders founded religion jewish hopes messiah king artificial extension original promises made gd constructing history abraham moses wrote promise land nationhood jewish people accomplished eventually rule king david christians came along later decided would claim fulfillment promise expanded promise preaching heavenly kingdom john jc speaking father abraham rejoiced see day say glad would nice tie approval jesus abraham abraham knew nothing jesus messiah anything christian tried failed find event old testament corresponds johns little prophecy par course see st john making old testament backings like forerunner matthew many christians know faith many foundations fraud surprising still cling potters field told jesus betrayed jerusalem one followers judas iscariot matthew writes mt throwing pieces silver temple judas departed chief priests taking silver said isnt lawful us put treasury since blood money bought potters field bury strangers fulfilled spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty pieces silver price price set sons israel gave potters field lord directed prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament scripture first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet zechariah utters verses matthew makes use zech weighed wages thirty shekels silver yhvh said cast treasury lordly price paid took thirty shekels silver cast treasury house yhvh first verses zechariah deal betrayer messiah gd deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly gd would send judah israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthews quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariahs context whereas potters field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthews track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judass situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests would put money treasury worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite course average thursdaynight bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthews work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified mt gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted would drink crucified divided garments among casting lots might fulfilled spoken prophet parted garments among upon vesture cast lots first vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine type roman soldiers drank regularly find right jesus dies soldiers give drink polluted gall jn jesus said thirst bowl vinegar stood put sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth received vinegar said finished matthew seems drawing passage prophets one psalms ps looked pity none comforters found none gave poison food lit put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink add punishment upon punishment may acquittal thee let blotted book living course sour wine offered jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks gd damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospels says lk jesus said father forgive dont know matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesuss drink meat psalm stipulates prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings nd psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesuss clothes divided told great thing turns happened often felon days soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesuss clothes man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions nd psalm psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemies becomes song praise yhvh hope taken context parts seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse god god forsaken far helping far words groaning oh god cry day dont answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like lamb led mute shearers indeed jesus doesnt much groaning even cross certainly cry day night cross worm man scorned men see mock make faces wag heads committed cause yhvh let deliver delights seems fit jesuss execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm many bulls encompass open mouths widely like ravening roaring lion yea dogs round company evildoers encircle pierced hands feet see bones divide garments among cast lost raiment yhvh far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion afflicted soul horns wild bull would seem quite convincing im sure early christian fathers wrote prophecy thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words pierced really exist psalm correct hebrew translation yea dogs round company evildoers encircles like lion hands feet hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion kaari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word kaaru add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translators chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty translators apart erroneous verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalms true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce hands palms rather forearms doesnt say much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples scars palms facts arent bound religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability time attempt draw many direct links psalm lord jesus psalm like many others minds gospel writers compiled stories interpretations jesuss life death much scriptures may contributed actually got written question serious repercussions christian theology easy see faithful fundamentalists events new testament might enhanced scribes eager matthew less speculate simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims far said good things st matthew reference piercing looks lot like jesuss crucifixion johns gospel recount written years fact tells us jesuss execution jn one soldiers pierced side spear came blood water things took place scripture fulfilled look theyve pierced course built passage taken blatantly context prophet zechariah tells us much nation israel split jerusalem judah go war zc yhvh give victory judah day seek destroy nations come jerusalem judah pour spirit compassion supplication jerusalem look pierced mourn weep bitterly like weep firstborn child johns attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker matthews attempts matthew least usually excontexts one passage johns errors grossly obvious blatant speak well gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded reckoned transgressors arrest jesus quickly executed claiming jewish kingship messiahship according one version gospel tale jesus gets executed along two thieves mk crucified two robbers one right one left scripture fulfilled says reckoned transgressors mark trying link jesus passage isaiah servant nation israel passage messiah one reads whole chapter isaiah surrounding chapters one sees servant nation verses also servant gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal also happens fit description jesus passage really messiah still clear executing jesus two thieves would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesus would fittingly fulfill whole ministry considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least case see mark could made better analogy general comparisons mark goes tell us crucified jesus also reviled expected couple robbers course later recount st luke decides change things luke tells us lk one criminals hanged railed arent messiah save us certainly fits marks recount tells people crucified jesus said save robbers luke goes criminal rebuked first saying dont fear gd since sentence condemnation indeed justly receiving due reward deeds man done nothing wrong said jesus remember come kingdom jesus answered verily say today paradise little dialogue seems highly contrived stretches imagination bit see picture one ruffian rebuking fellow criminal eloquent speech rather strange picture criminal lamenting goodness punishment justness suffering man apparently noble principle doesnt seem likely robber wonder amount theatrics created luke course lukes recount also disagrees marks luke one criminal revile jesus easy enough discount discrepancy account made wish believe part error free words gd avenue open yet another example writer trying take old testament passage expand reinterpret suit theology case embroidery creates embarrassing problems seen end world mt comes perhaps one extraordinary embarrassing passages new testament found three synoptic gospel stories casts unfavourable doubt whole theory christianity jesus mentions destruction jewish temples buildings disciples ask end world warning disciples tell us temples destruction sign coming close age jesus take care one leads astray many come name saying christ hear wars rumours wars must take place end yet nation rise nation beginning birthpangs deliver put death false prophets arise lead many astray endures end saved gospel preached throughout whole world testimony nations end come see desolation spoken prophet daniel let judea flee mountains immediately tribulation days sun darkened stars fall heaven appear sign son man heaven tribes earth mourn see son man coming send angels gather elect learn lesson fig tree soon branch becomes tender puts forth leaves know summer near also see things know near gate truly say generation pass away things take place day hour one knows angels son father therefore also must ready son man coming hour expect clear jesus thought world would within lifetimes least disciples tells although doesnt know exact day hour come thus must ready theologians wet pants panic find way holy error unfortunately jesus made explicit told disciples generation would still around end particular prepare prepare swept away resorted removing inerrant nature bible said phrase generation shall pass away really means race people pass away course word generation used many times refer exactly generation disciples interesting notion god decided learn greek didnt learn well enough make clear quite obvious rest dialogue disciples least supposed live end world charge mistranslation completely blown away looking apostles responses becomes abundantly clear rev peter john rev jesus meant exactly said end near years christians rationalised th chapter matthew ignored meaning altogether years waited executed leader come back hearing wars rumours wars sure coming soon surely must must wait imagine tired must sitting around holy waiting right moment spring shortly crucifixion jesus nazareth joshuabenjoseph died said three days three days three nights three periods time three eternal seconds three whatever decide makes less trouble seen resurrected glowing divine radiance saviour decided wasnt best interests new religion stick around therefore disappeared sight heaven story goes anyway seen many things attributed jesus people got around writing gospel stories jesus fulfiller prophecy scripture seen though matter quite shaky throughout church history christians held fast faith simple belief doctrinal objections could solved argumentation brute force faith forgetfulness kept away question question investigate never easiest way treat matters thus years prophecies cited new testament gone largely accepted things may well continue way time pausing moment consider way doctrines christianity accepted used properly improperly support wars persecution suppose one prophecy christianity securely keep hold mt jesus dont think come bring peace earth havent come bring peace rather sword,16
