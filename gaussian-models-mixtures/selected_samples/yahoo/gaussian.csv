Health,"Title: What causes shin splints and what is the best way to treat them?  How can I avoid them in the future?, Content: I have started running again recently and now have shin splints so bad I can hardly walk.  I  am a 39 year old woman in fairly good physical shape, I work out regularly, not over weight and I have no physical problems short of the shin splints..  I walk on the tread mill and eliptical regularly with out much problem.  The problem didn't start until I started running out side.  I run on a concrete bridge with a slight grade (incase that makes a difference)., Answer: Shin splints are most commonly caused by overpronation (foot roles in too much at the toe off phase of your gait/running motion). A neutral foot lands on the outside corner of your heel, roles inwards so that it is flat and then roles out on the angle of your toes at toe off. An overpronated foot lands on the outside of the heel, roles in flat but continues to roll in and comes off even with or inside the big toe side of the shoe. The reason this is a problem is that the muscle that is supposed to role you out at toe off (tibialis anterior muscle) is not strong enough to counter the weight of your body that has rolled your foot inwards too far. It continues to pull until it actually pulls itself off the bone where it attaches (this is what shinsplints are - shin splints are not a muscle fibre strain you are actually tearing muscle from the bone which is why it hurts so much and takes so long to heal). The reason why you didn't feel it before is because under less load (walking = less downward force and elliptical = no downward force) your body wasn't thrown into am overpronated position. Now that your are running the repetition of the overpronated state is resulting in shin splints. \nTo get rid of the shin splints you must first rest the muscle, ice wil help with the inflamation and pain. Next you need to get a really good pair of shoes designed to work with YOUR body. Just going and spending a lot of money will not gaurantee a good pair for you. It would be like buying a Ferarri for off roading - it's a great car but not for what you need. Look for a shoe that is designed for motion control. These styles have a very wide sole through the arch, are stiff if you try to ""wring it out"", have a very hard ""heel counter"" and have some type of a ""medial post"" (usually a dark grey foam of higher density running along the arch sie of the foot). If you aren't comfortable with these terms then go to your local running store and ask them. If they don't know these terms then walk away - they are not trained enough to assist you. A couple of models/brands that do produce some very good shoes for overpronators (motion control shoes) are Asics (gel 2100 series), Saucony (grid stable as one example) and New Balance. Do some research on their websites and they will have pictures to describe what I've talked about.",2

Politics & Government,"Title: I am a American woman in love with Indian man. What is the easiest way to get him to America?, Content: , Answer: First question to you is, have you met this man in person and spent a significant amount of time with him in person?  and I mean face to face, not over the phone or webcams, etc.  If not, you want to do this first, and you might want to first visit his country if you have not done so, then next, bring him over on a tourist visa to visit you.  Internet relationships can be a great start, but the real proof is face to face, day to day.\n\nAlso, because these are very different cultures, do a lot of research on the Indian culture, so that you are well-informed.  Love does not conquer all, you need to be ready to deal with the obstacles and difficulties, and knowing what they might be will be most helpful to you.\n\nMake sure that he is not just wanting to find a way to the U.S.  A lot of Indians want to move to Canada or the U.S., and some will use marriage if they have to, to accomplish this.  You would rather be aware of this now, than later.\n\nWhen you are ready to bring him over permanently, if that is your decision, then you will want to go to the Immigration website and read through the material and fill out the application forms to go through the process.  If you need or want help, consult an immigration lawyer, preferably one with a good reputation.\n\nHere are links for you:\n\nVisa Home Page\nhttp://www.travel.state.gov/visa/visa_1750.html\n\nImmigration Home Page\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/graphics/",2
