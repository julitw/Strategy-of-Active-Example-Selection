Click on Run. Type in MSConfig. Then click on OK. You would have the system configuration utility. On that click on the startup tab. Under this, click on disable all. Then click on apply. Then check only those options that have a description of ur anti-virus and important software that u think is needed. Then click on apply again and then click on ok. It will ask you to restart the computer. Go ahead and do it. Once the computer starts up, it should be much faster. \n\nComing to the icons, first of all, what you could try is deleting them. Right-click on them and then click on delete. If that does not help then, right-click on the empty space on the desktop and then point to ""Arrange Icons by"" and then click on Show Desktop Icons, if it is already checked. This should take out all the icons from the desktop. \n\nAny other questions, get back on here! ;)",8

Politics & Government,"Title: Do you think illegal immigrants help or hurt the economy?, Content: , Answer: The approximately 40 million illegal immigrants in this country definitely hurt the economy.  \n\nThey took away a lot of jobs like roofing and construction jobs from the American people.  You used to see two white or black men putting on the roof.  Now you see 14 illegal aliens on a roof - all making below minimum wage.\n\nAnd most of their money gets sent back to Mexico.  That hurts the economy also.\n\nIllegals have put a real stand still on health care for millions of Americans.  I had cervical cancer while I lived in South Texas.  The doctor's office gave me an ""emergency"" appointment for 6 months away.  They couldn't see or treat me and the entire building was filled with illegal aliens and their 8 to 10 children. And of course the mothers were all pregnant.\n\nWell, I took my belongings in a bag and took the Greyhound bus to West Tennessee to live our the rest of my life.  They gave me surgery immediately and today I am cancer free.\n\nI would have died if I remained in South Texas.....)(",6

Health,"Title: How bad is it to have your right colon removed? I am 75 years old,and never been in the hospital..?, Content: My doctor talked me into one of those colon tests.      After test ,They told me to make appointment to have my right colon removed..Not cancer, Answer: My husband had a foot of his colon removed and is doing fine. However, if they remove the entire colon (I'm assuming there's something like hardening of the arteries taking place there) you may have to have a colostromy bag. My brother just had that procedure and is also doing very well. Be sure to find out exactly what your doctor is planning on doing....knowing what to expect will help ease your worry. \n\nSurgey can be frightening and there are always risks involved, but I am sure it is for the best. You won't feel anything during the operation, but you will be sore afterwards. They'll give you medicine to relieve the pain and place you on a special diet until you're healed inside. Today they make smaller incisions and people tend to heal faster. You will probably be allowed to go home after just a few days.\n\nI wish the best and may you make a speedy recovery!",6

It seems slow though, so maybe you should keep it that pace, for a little while longer at least. She seems to kind of want it that way, she's cautious perhaps, or shy. Anyway, just keep talking to her, but don't push yourself everywhere she is all of a sudden! That could really turn her off! Get to know her friends.
