Sports,"Title: Now the Alpha male Monty Brown is in WWE do u reckon he will be on raw,smackdown or ecw?, Content: Monty Brown was in TNA b4 he signed a deal wid wwe, Answer: Used to watch wrestling years ago, now, not so much.  However, I do follow the career of Monty Brown as he grew up about 10 houses north of mine and while he is about 9 years older then me, he used to play football with my brother and his friends, in which my bro is 12 years older.\n\nI recall Monty coming back to my HS back in the mid 90's to give a speech long before his wrestling career and a couple years after he got out of the NFL.  \n\nMaybe if I'm flipping the channels and I happen to see him on one of the new shows, I would watch, but wrestling hasn't been the same since the days of WWE/WCW being separate companies on separate channels at the same time on Monday nights.  It's more of a male soap opera today then it used to be.  Much greater developed story lines, but that isnt why I used to watch it back in the day.",9

Health,"Title: How bad is it to have your right colon removed? I am 75 years old,and never been in the hospital..?, Content: My doctor talked me into one of those colon tests.      After test ,They told me to make appointment to have my right colon removed..Not cancer, Answer: My husband had a foot of his colon removed and is doing fine. However, if they remove the entire colon (I'm assuming there's something like hardening of the arteries taking place there) you may have to have a colostromy bag. My brother just had that procedure and is also doing very well. Be sure to find out exactly what your doctor is planning on doing....knowing what to expect will help ease your worry. \n\nSurgey can be frightening and there are always risks involved, but I am sure it is for the best. You won't feel anything during the operation, but you will be sore afterwards. They'll give you medicine to relieve the pain and place you on a special diet until you're healed inside. Today they make smaller incisions and people tend to heal faster. You will probably be allowed to go home after just a few days.\n\nI wish the best and may you make a speedy recovery!",7

Family & Relationships,"Title: about a girl?, Content: I met this girl its been about 7 weeks now.  I had offcially introduced myself too her about 8 weeks ago and for the first time today she  called me by my first name well hey ...... when before she would just smile and say hi.  This sounds like a interesting fact that she is into me right.  She loves to be with her friends all the time i don't feel like its right to just come up and sit with them all i don't know them or should i set with them all.  I just sit with my friends or will this give her the idea that maybe iam not interested in her. although i have given her clear facts that iam like asking her out., Answer: The relationship between you two is coming along. It seems slow though, so maybe you should keep it that pace, for a little while longer at least. She seems to kind of want it that way, she's cautious perhaps, or shy. Anyway, just keep talking to her, but don't push yourself everywhere she is all of a sudden! That could really turn her off! Get to know her friends. When she's with them come up to her and say ""hi"", and then politely turn to her friends and greet them as well. She'll introduce you and....You get the picture:)",0

Health,"Title: Do you know the name of the ""hot"" yoga?, Content: There is a type of yoga that is held in a room with a high temperature (like 102 degrees). Do you know the name of that type of yoga?, Answer: I am a conscientious but nondenominational exerciser, and coming to Bikram (a.k.a. ""Hot"") Yoga began more as a scheduling convenience than devotion to its unvarying regimen of 26 poses (asanas), each performed twice and held for what can seem like forever over the course of the nearly two-hour class. \n\nYoga comes in almost as many guises as there are yoga instructors, but most classes build on the same basic foundation of poses performed sitting, standing and lying down. Although some, like the Sun Salutation, consist of a progression of steps, more often the goal is to work gradually toward a single ideal shape: the bow, the triangle, the cobra. My needs are simple: I want supervised, intensive stretching, and every yoga class I've ever attended offers at least that. \n\nThe truth is, I hated this Bikram class when I started. At first I returned only because I was desperate — the victim of a muscle-kinking bout of business travel (cramped airline seats and strange beds). Our teacher, Leah Weisman, seemed to talk incessantly. The room was always full, from 30 to 50 people. And the space was intentionally overheated. \n\nTrue Hot Yoga requires a room temperature as high as 105°F, supposedly so muscles warm up quickly and stretch more easily. This gym's drafty old studio achieves only Balmy Yoga — about 81°F — which is just as well. I've experienced optimal Bikram temperatures just once, and frankly, that's way too much bodily fluid shared and dripped and flicked around among a bunch of people who know one another in anything less than a biblical fashion. \n\nBut the thing I hated most about the class was that at the very end, while everyone was resting for a few minutes in the stillness of Shavasana, the corpse pose (designed to quiet the mind), Leah broke into song. Classroom scuttlebutt is that she has been known to sing On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever, but I've only heard her sing verses from New Age-y folk tunes that mention planets spinning around the sun and the Earth Mother calling her children home. \n\nWhy torture myself so? Simple: love triumphs over hate. As it turns out, Leah is an excellent teacher. Week after week she goes through the same routine without ever falling into autopilot. She is very ""present in the moment,"" as she might describe it. Leah offers cautions about overexertion, suggestions on how to do each pose at various levels of challenge, and great good humor. Last week she talked about a meditation seminar she had attended and called the impromptu lecture her ""sermon on the mat."" \n\nAs a gasping heater blows lukewarm air around the room, she intersperses practical instruction (""Pull up your quads as you pull down your hamstrings"") with abstract concepts (""Remember, you're burning new neurological pathways"") that I take or leave, depending on my mood. \n\nLeah wanders among the students, propelling the class forward even as she stops to adjust an arm angle here or perform a thyroid-massaging chin tuck there. She urges noncompetition, with oneself (""However you do the posture today is how you should do the posture"") and with others (""How can you compare yourself to your neighbor? You don't have the same body!""). Her monologue becomes a mantra, returning my oft-wandering focus back to the pose I'm attempting. Where is my center of balance? Can I feel my spine stretch if I imagine my head and tailbone pulling in opposite directions? How does my alignment shift when I turn my foot three degrees to the right? \n\nSome people criticize Bikram for being too arduous, but as with all yoga, much of the responsibility falls to the individual. I welcome this opportunity to eschew faster, higher and stronger in favor of deeper. In this regard, the simplicity of Bikram's poses is one more way to avoid being distracted from myself. \n\nTo spend this much time slowly and gently stretching is a luxu",1

Health,"Title: Does the Push/Pull method,where you work your push muscles one day, then your pulls the next,get good results?, Content: I would like to know if using the push/pull method gets you good results for both toning and muscle building, what benifits there are to using this method, and if its not a good method, why it isn't, and an alternative?, Answer: The push/pull method is a good method of lifting weights, but it's not particularly better than any other method.  It is only one component of the entire equation.  Equally important is your form, the number of reps and sets you do, how long your workout is, how much rest you take in between sets, the speed of both the concentric component and the eccentric component, and others as well.  The push/pull method just happens to be one of the more popular ways of lifting.\n\n\nOne advantage of this method is that you are exercising muscles that wrok together in one session.  For example, usually the pecs and the triceps are worked in the same sessions.  The triceps work as a synergist during most pec movements (meaning they help the pecs to complete the movement).  So that if you do your chest workout first, then you do have to work your triceps as hard because they have been pre-exhaust by the chest workout.\n\nOn the other hand, by seperating synergistic muscle groups, for example doing triceps and chest on seperate days, then the triceps will get worked twice as many times during the week -- once during the workout specifically aimed at the triceps, and once as a synergist during the chest workout.\n\nFor more information on all off this, see the link below.  It's probably the best written book on weightlifting and exercise on the market today.",7
