"Last day of 2019 : I’ll be honest I had high hopes for today. My family and I were all gonna sit in the living room watching friends but not just watching, laughing and talking together as well. But now it’s the last two hours of the year and my parents are watching something else, my brother is playing video games and I’m stuck in the basement feeling sorry for myself.  

The last hours and I’m depressed. I’m going to start the new year depressed. Sometimes I hate that I have hope... it somehow hurts me more

Once it’s 12:00 I’m gonna go to bed, listen to music while staring up at the ceiling just letting depression take over, like usual.",moderate,1
"2020 is the year I take a stand against depression. : Depression is a greedy soab. It takes far too much time, far too many lives. It ruins relationships with families, spouses, friends... It ruins the mind of those it afflicts. Treatment is a long process, with so many wrong roads to go down. 

I have tried pills; many kinds. I have tried therapy many times. The depression I have is something I can't fix with these things, I have learnt this. It took over 10 years to figure it out but better late than never. And while there may be no true end to it, I've found the best way to get over feeling depressed (in my case) is to actively rebel against it. 

""I don't want to cook dinner, I'll just have toast.""   
""I can't go for a walk, it's too cold.""   
""I don't feel like doing anything."" etc etc... You know the drill I'm sure.

But you know what, depression? Fuck you. I may not be motivated to do anything at all right now but out of sheer spite, as a complete middle finger to this horrible mental affliction... I'm going to prove you wrong. You do not own me.",moderate,1
"Can anyone relate. struggling : First time posting on reddit. yay 

Things in my life are getting to the point where it feels like a mountain of experiences are pressing me down and I feel like I can’t breathe or handle any stress without breaking down and crying all the time. I feel ok for short periods and then all of a sudden, whoosh - it’s like a wave knocks my feet out and pulls me underwater for hours and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve gone to therapy and most of the time I feel better for a couple hours afterward and then it goes right back to this dark heaviness. I feel hopeless and like I can’t relate to a lot of people in the city which is why I’ve temporary located back to this small town where I spent some time a few years ago..

highlight reel:

-mentally disabled older brother + emotionally unavailable/blocked parents (who never explained what was wrong with him until I asked when I was 14. We didn’t talk/hug/ate dinner maybe 4x/year together. lot of anger and talking behind each other’s backs since I can remember-mostly my dad doing this. 

-close family friend (like an uncle to me) drunk drove off a ridge and killed himself when I &amp; his son was 13 (close childhood friend) who then later accidentally killed himself of a meth overdose when we were 19/20 

-a year prior ^^ my best childhood friend was killed in a car accident and it felt like nobody I knew could relate 

-dislocated left shoulder 6 times over 7 years, had surgery when 16 &amp; 22, but the guy who did the first operation messed it up and screwed up my shoulder/drilled too much into my bone. felt like I didn’t have a say as my parents decided it at the time and I went into a super dark depression afterward. chronic pain in both shoulders and neck. feel like I’m 70 sometimes always thinking about my body  

-been sexually assaulted like 5 times, was held down and choked while someone came inside me in the back of a minivan. another time was roofied and woke up naked in a bed of a guy I had no clue who he was and how I got there, couldn’t remember anything. passed out drunk in my bed another time after party I organized at home and woke up to a friend’s friend having anal sex with me. etc. Recent turn of events has me reliving the most recent one and it makes me feel so worthless and like it’s all my fault esp since it was so painful and has affected me the most. sometimes I feel like I hate my body

-on that note I seem to keep attracting guys who aren’t patient or sensitive enough to take things slow and I keep getting hurt by things moving too fast even when I keep saying that I need gentle progression/mega trust first but I feel like I’m just continuing to lose hope at genuinely connecting with anyone. I get attention from guys who tell me I’m cute/smart but I feel so detached from my body, like cardboard. feel hopeless and scared to trust men

-I know I’m not fat but feel like I am always criticizing my body, I look in the mirror and see huge hips and I tell myself I’m “too big” and take up too much space and my butt’s not big enough, etc. From being told I was too skinny as a little girl and then gaining weight after 1st surgery. Troubling? thing is now I weigh 139, I’m 5’10, which means I haven’t weighed this little since I was like 14. I’ve been told multiple times by guys I’ve dated that I’m hot and sometimes I look at myself and think, whoa I’m super skinny what am I talking about, And then it goes right back to critic eyes and it seems like everything I wear makes me look huge. also, as a performer in college, I got a lot of feedback to be skinnier and it feels like it’s permanently affected how I see myself. Like it’s a good thing if I go a day without eating even though I know that’s not healthy. does anyone relate??

-survived a mass shooting at work this year and now I feel like the ptsd is making me insane. It got better and then it got worse. I’m scared to go out grocery shopping for too long, I couldn’t even go out tonight because of all the fireworks sound like gunshots and I still feel like I’m in a state of shock 

-Student debt’s only close to like $40k but I got an arts degree and now just feel screwed after having taken time off for this 2nd shoulder operation and feeling so insecure/doubting myself &amp; my abilities to do anything “productive” // “of worth” with my life. 

-climate change extinction you know the drill

Everything just feels pointless and I have such a lack of motivation to do most things. Even the littlest things take so much energy. I feel like I can’t even talk to people for extended periods of time because I just want to lie down or be alone

TL;DR life’s been hard and I feel broken and hopeless. does anyone relate",moderate,1
"My mum died two days ago, my heart is hurting so bad : I feel like I will never stop crying and feeling teary. My heart feels so sad for my Mum who won't get to do the things she loved anymore. She'll never get to feel the warmth again and get a really dark tan like she always did. It destroys me that her death could have been possibly prevented if she had been treated sooner. She was only 54, she should still be here. 

I'm torturing myself thinking of all the stupid times that I didn't act the way I should have just because I was too depressed. Or the things I didn't do that she asked me too or hinted/suggested. I had the ability to make her happy and I didnt. I upset her just because of my negative mind and how effected she was by me. All the lost moments where I was in the room but my mind wasn't present in the slightest.

She was suffering for a long time with alcoholism and unfortunately cancer took over her body. I feel like more could have been done to stop her from dying, I feel like I should have done more and been more helpful with her physical and mental health. I should have realised she was so unwell in the weeks before her death, there were days when I would look at her and just think oh god you look so unwell, why did I not say something? She might still be here if she had got to the hospital earlier. 

My heart hurts thinking about whether she was scared or worried. Whether she knew she was dying or had accepted her fate. Whether she knew she was leaving us and how distraught we were. When she was awake but delirious I couldn't look at her without crying, she must've known something was wrong because she almost never saw me cry. It brings me some peace to know she can't think and can't hurt anymore, her mind is resting and she is free from the pain of life.

I honestly don't know how i'll get over this, I realise only now that she was such an important factor in my life, I depended on her and she depended on me. I should've been there for her.",moderate,1
"I feel guilty for being depressed : I feel guilty for being depressed...which makes me feel ungrateful...which makes me guilty...which makes me more depressed. 29F
I have many blessings in my life - my health, my family, my loving partner, a great education, a great job, financial resources, a lot of wonderful things...but I'm still depressed on a day-to-day basis and I feel terribly guilty about it. Based on all of these blessings, I should be very happy and content, but I'm not. I am melancholy at times, agitated, irritable and unpleasant. 
I have scrupulosity OCD, which is essentially an overly active moral compass and makes me empathize and feel compassion very deeply. It also comes with a lot of guilt. If I see a homeless person or someone less privileged, I often think, ""that should be me"" or "" maybe God should give me something to REALLY cry about. and then I'll learn to appreciate my life.""

"parents suck : I’m very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn’t really affect me except for with my family. I’m not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I’m annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don’t see me as much as they used to’. Basically I can’t do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don’t avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much’, which really can’t be done. 

On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we’re currently in and spent the night outside (we’re on a ski vacation, it get’s below -15°C here at night).

"Cringing over my own socializing attempts : A few weeks ago a friend invited me to her party. I was struggling to motivate myself and get out of bed but I had promised her I would come and eventually I got dressed.

I was not expecting much because she is the only person I really knew there and I am not very good with meeting new people. But surprisingly I was having fun and talked to a bunch of people and even started conversations (!!!). I guess the alcohol helped a bit... 

When I got home I was really proud of myself for going to the party and especially talking to people and not sitting in a corner quietly. The feeling of making progress gave me a little confidence boost.

Fast forward to now. When I think back I feel like I was putting on a mask so I look like I am a social and fun person. Thinking about those conversations really makes me cringe because now they feel so fake and pointless. Like I was just having them to have a smooth, non-awkward evening and staying in my ""party persona"". 

I get the same feeling when I think about times where I opened up to my 2 best friends about having mental problems.

I cut out the empty but never replaced it with anything meaningful, the things that distracted me from the monotony are gone, but all I have right now is the monotonous day in day out. I know my wife sees it, she’s called me out on it, but I shrug it off and say I’m tired. I love my family but right now I feel just feel drained. More than anything I think I just needed to say this, if only to try and shake myself out of apathy.",moderate,1
"Realised how ugly I must be. : I'm a guy... but it still hurts a lot. This week spent with family during Christmas and New Years has completely hammered home the fact that I'm ugly. Or, the ugly one in the family. And extended family.

I know I've always looked terrible in photos, but just seeing me in a bunch of them alongside my siblings and cousins this week, and seeing people on Facebook commenting about and complimenting them but ignoring my presence... it hurts, even though they didn't even say anything. It's just that I definitely know I don't look good, and it feels like everyone else is smart enough to know it too, which makes me shrink into my chair even more.

On top of that, my sisters were getting attention from different people all week. Again, I know how ridiculous I must sound typing this as a *guy*. But I already feel invisible and worthless enough as is in my life... and this week couldn't have made me feel anymore unwanted and alone, from family, friends and strangers alike.",moderate,1
"Why was I so unhappy at university? : I am 27, went to university when I was 18.

I really didn't enjoy any of the 5 years I was there. It was just 'ok'. I really prefer working life. I wish I could relive those years without the same anxiety about money.

Friends and acquaintances seem to only have great recollections about getting pissed, nights out, fucking.

I had very little of that and the thought is bringing me down. I feel like there must be something wrong with me because I am not particularly social.

I'd like to have more friends but I seem to have a hard time making them. In my halls I didn't fit in and I felt like I became the butt of every joke when I left the common room. I could hear a lot of what they said through the walls. The more I heard the more I withdrew.

I saw a psychotherapist (£70 a week!) for a couple of months. He said I didn't realise it, but just by being me I make a lot of people feel insecure. That always sounded like BS to me but it stuck with me anyway.

The older I get the less friends I have as they all move away. I'm married, I met my partner when I was 20. She is always in and out of work which stresses me out, I feel like I am always saving and paying for two people.",moderate,1
Anyone else feel violently depressed? : [removed],moderate,2
"2020 is in less than 2 hours and I don't feel ready : Everything is against me, especially during these holidays. My friends, my family, myself are all fucking me up deeply. 2019 was not a good year for me. How am I supposed to survive 2020 when theres no one left to help me?",moderate,0
"Depression or laziness? : For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 
Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.
Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time. This has been going on for at least a year or two and I really need to get work done and get on with my life so I don't fall behind. Any help would be appreciated :)",moderate,1
"$1,000,000 or no more depression? : Which would you pick?

And do you think if you chose the money it would help or get rid of your depression?",not depression,0
"Negative Nancy : I’ve recently started dating someone who I’ve had a crush on since I was 13 (Now 23). I’m so happy that it’s finally working out with us, but I think I upset him a little bit when I told him that I haven’t said anything to my parents. He knows my parents well and they really love him. I just am too scared to tell them because it’s so hard for me to be optimistic about anything. I don’t want to tell them because I don’t want to deal with telling them it didn’t work out, and it’s so hard for me to believe that it will. I wish I could be positive, but it’s just really hard for me.",moderate,1
I’m sure I’ll die alone at this point : I know I need therapy and to work through my shit before trying to date. But I feel really fucking ugly and like I’m going to die alone even if I work on myself. I keep pushing people away and blew it with a good guy a few months ago. Confident I’m going to die alone and I really don’t want to be alive anymore to think about this pain.,moderate,1
"How to not lose your focus while being productive? : Any questions?  

It's like a problem right now on me.  


Have you felt like when you're learning online on youtube and you jump onto clips that are junk...

It's like you lose something after you do that.

You felt lost.

And like I am stuck...

I don't know what should I do next it's like have a path to walk but that path has a locked door so I can't go through",moderate,1
