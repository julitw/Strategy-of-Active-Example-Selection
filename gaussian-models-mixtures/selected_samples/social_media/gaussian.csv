"I've decided to be celibate and kill myself. : I don't want to live, I hate life, but I have dreams, pipe dream they might be, but fucking still.

I'm about to turn 18 and my plan is to give life my best shot and try to live to the fullest until I'm 25, then I'll be hanging myself, its long enough to spare me of my suffering but also enough to experience life, if it truly does have something to offer.

The reason for celibacy is fairly obvious, If I'll be dead by 25 so It would be cruel to fall in love and break a girl like that, I simply despise casual sex, so thats off the table as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The thought of careers and retirement and all sorts of fucking stress is just lifted off my shoulders by this, I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic so love would be nice, but not at the cost of someones mental health.",moderate,0
"Ever wonder when your family will give up on you? : I consistently disappoint them. I'm too depressed to offer them anything in return. Really, I'm a bitter and angry person, I don't bring anything good to the table, I don't enrich their lives. They love me and I don't deserve it. Eventually they'll see I'm trash. I'd feel less guilty about wanting to die if they just stopped trying to help me.",moderate,1

"I don't think my friends are better off with me in their life. : I've spent the last few days trying to accept that my friends are better off without me. They don't think I care about them, and they think I need to change. But I can't. I don't know how. I have done everything I can to try and avoid hurting them and to make their life better. I care about them a lot. And I think that somehow they still care about me. They've said that the only reason they're still around is that they're afraid I'll hurt or kill myself if they're not there to stop me. I want to do what's best for them. Surely if I cut them out of my life, and avoid meeting new people, but I don't hurt myself, then they'll be happy and safe, and their fears will go unrealized. That has to be better than accidentally hurting everyone I care about over and over and over again.",not depression,1
"My antidepressants used to work. : I’ve been on antidepressants for ten months. I’m seeing two therapists and one psychologist because my family is skeptical about depression. The therapist I see more told me my dad was abusive but I felt weird about it so I denied it. I haven’t seen my dad in two years so I’ve been visiting my dad and family for the last two weeks. I see him treating my siblings the way he treated me and any small thing I do, such as telling him I’m hungry, angers him to the point of raising his voice and accusing me of lying. My old feelings and depression symptoms are back. I feel like life is a waste because my depression isn’t situational, everyone’s life is worse when I’m around despite people telling me the opposite I think they’re lying, I’m pathologically crying again (I won’t think about anything that makes me sad and but I’ll start crying), and I have no appetite. I’m already at a really high dose so I hope this is temporary.",moderate,0
"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent.",moderate,0
"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, 

For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 

1st jan 2020 

I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different after

Ive never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don’t know how I can achieve that at this point. I’ve contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can’t do this alone. Therapists are expensive. 

I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. 

The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. 

Girlfriend

I’ve been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don’t want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. 

Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don’t know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO’s come up. 

I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don’t know them. It’ll never work and it doesn’t, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they’re not happy with their lives and marriage. They’re miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO’s. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don’t want this.  

The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. 

I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don’t want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. 


My own apartment

I still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It’s too much sometimes. I can’t go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. 

I have been wanting to move out all year but that’s not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don’t know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I’d rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I’m in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. 

Band

Music is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn’t have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  

I’ve always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. 

This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I’m not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. 

Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it’s a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. 

They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don’t do these kinds of things. It’s this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. 

I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn’t cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this. 

They’ve never given me a proper reason why they’re so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn’t want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It’s a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade. I will get there one way or another.",moderate,0

"I feel like giving up and I dont know who to talk here's me rambling : So I have been on a journey to find my way of expressing myself through art and I've been trying to pursue it but I cant help to think I will never be good enough for anything. Either in art or hell even in relationships with a significant other and family. I always feel like a burden... My temptation to self destruct is always trying to put me in, through lust and selfishness. Although I try my best to fight them but its SO DIFFICULT. I dont know if something Is wrong with me or if this is normal but good god... if this is normal why do I even try?!... I Care so much about the person I am with and he is so patient and understanding but I feel if I would let him know about this lustful side of me he would would have really bad anxiety with me and leave. I dont have any friends or family around me so this is... just me. I'm so alone.

"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, 

For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 

1st jan 2020 

I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different after

Ive never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don’t know how I can achieve that at this point. I’ve contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can’t do this alone. Therapists are expensive. 

I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. 

The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. 

Girlfriend

I’ve been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don’t want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. 

Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don’t know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO’s come up. 

I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don’t know them. It’ll never work and it doesn’t, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they’re not happy with their lives and marriage. They’re miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO’s. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don’t want this.  

The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. 

I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don’t want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. 


My own apartment

I still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It’s too much sometimes. I can’t go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. 

I have been wanting to move out all year but that’s not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don’t know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I’d rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I’m in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. 

Band

Music is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn’t have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  

I’ve always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. 

This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I’m not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. 

Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it’s a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. 

They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don’t do these kinds of things. It’s this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. 

I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn’t cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this. 

They’ve never given me a proper reason why they’re so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn’t want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It’s a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade. I will get there one way or another.",moderate,0

I don't think I would have done anything, but I was so scared I couldn't be alone with myself.

"Depression or laziness? : For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 
Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.
Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time.
