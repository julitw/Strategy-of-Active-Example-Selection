I feel like shit : I feel like shit. I've cried non stop for the past 5 days. Not sure what's going on. Ever since my 16th birthday a month ago everything has gone downhill. I'm suicidal but I'm too afraid to tell anyone. My nurse increased my meds about 3 months ago but I feel worse. I can't stop crying. Crying. Crying. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't think I can make it.,severe,0

"A new start! : First wish you all a happy new year.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I reached the bottom and now I see a way I can get myself out of it.

It was very hard and dark in time, but reading some of the comments here made me realize I have not much to complain, I am 55(m) and divorced,  have a high education and decent job, living in a nice place (which Osama way too expensive for me at the moment)  but I have set up a budget to payback my debt and looking for a room mate to ease the burden of high rent, because I am not going to be able to get a new contract with my current salary


I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

Just cleaned up the medicine cabinet and realized I have about 20 packs of zoloft, and,Xanax I never used and it explains some of my mood swings.

Going to return them to pharmacy and set up schedule to take my medicines on time!

Going to start the new decade with a positive attitude,  and realized living in a shit hole dirty apartment was making me sad, so weekly clean up, daily walk in the park and happy thoughts are going to be my new year plan. Printed on the door to check out every week.",not depression,0
"I fucking hate everything : My entire school holidays have been consumed by the fact that I have to go back to school. Its all I can think about. I hate school so much, every second I spend there is torture. I really feel like dropping out and becoming a forklift driver or something. All I want from life is to just be able to survive and have basic entertainment. My parents expect me to get super high marks but i would genuinely prefer to get average marks. My dream is to go into psychology somewhere but idk if I can do well at school because I hate it.",moderate,0

 Being 2 hours away from my girlfriend and only being able to see her for 6 hours a week is weighing on me too. I know I should be grateful I have a girlfriend but it’s so exhausting having to talk to her all the time with little physical interaction.

I just don’t feel like myself.",moderate,0

"I feel like killing myself would be the only to make my existence meaningful : 1) I feel like an asshole for admitting this, but I know my family and friends would suffer and I want them to. I feel like it's the only way to make anyone FEEL anything, that I'll be permanently in their memories if I do that, and that I'm just an afterthought if I continue living.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.

5) Fantasizing about suicide is the ONLY nice thought I have now. Happy memories, people I've loved, achievements I've had, books I've read and loved, I know they ""must have happened"", but it's like I can't access that stuff.",severe,0
"I’ve begun to give up hope on doing anything well. I literally cannot do anything right anymore, cannot do anything well. 2020 is just going to be a reminder of how much time I’ve wasted. : Maybe this isn’t right to throw my thoughts out, but I just need to vent I think. With the new year of 2020 here, I honestly feel that I should be something more than I was excluding wisdom gained from aging. Growing up I was a huge gamer and I love games always have. I’ve also loved going into different skills and hobbies including cooking, drawing, instruments, and others. Then comes 2019, I just lose my ability to do everything. The people around me say that what I do is good, but that just isn’t true. They’re just being nice and can’t see that the numbers just don’t add up. I cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when I took a bite I honestly felt like breaking down just a little. It was so god awful that I told them I refuse to eat it. I got up and walked away. Didn’t eat dinner that night. I just wanna feel good at something. Anything. The one thing I thought, I had some sort of skill. Some sort of worth, was in games. I grew up with it, played years worth. So why do I suck so damn badly? Moba’s I just seem to never be able to do the right thing at the right time, constantly being flamed. FPS’s people constantly ask if I’m intentionally deranking. MMO’s I can’t even do the end game content because I just don’t have the items to do it, and I refuse to pay to win. I usually don’t let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can’t do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to. I lost practically everyone I used to know, and they moved on. Everyone does eventually. I don’t know if I’m depressed but, I feel like my worth is zero to none at this point. I told myself for the longest time, 2020 is gonna be my year, my strongest year yet, I’m a day in and I already feel like giving up. Pathetic right.",moderate,0

Selenium and Magnesium can help a lot with depression : I have depression myself it’s been very severe for a while but I’ve done research on what causes the chemical imbalances and how to fix them as well as what else is wrong. Mercury seems to be the main cause of depression and all mental illness but Selenium and Magnesium can get rid of it over the course of months. These two minerals are both antioxidants themselves and also both increase Glutathione which is the most important antioxidant in the body. Antioxidants fight oxidative a which is a major factor in depression. Selenium also increases metallothionein which is crucial for a good blood-brain barrier and protection from heavy metals. I’m taking these right now although only recently started but I just wanted to tell whoever sees this that there are a lot of different supplements that can help immensely with depression because they help the body deal with what’s wrong and what’s lacking. I highly recommend anybody struggling like me to start taking these two supplements it can’t hurt it can help a lot it could even cure your depression if it is from mercury toxicity like it is a lot of the time.,severe,0

"parents suck : I’m very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn’t really affect me except for with my family. I’m not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I’m annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don’t see me as much as they used to’. Basically I can’t do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don’t avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much’, which really can’t be done. 

On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we’re currently in and spent the night outside (we’re on a ski vacation, it get’s below -15°C here at night).

"Severe depression on weekends but not during week, at wit's end? Stealing all my joy. : Hi all.
I'm 26, have a diagnosed mental disorder (I feel uncomfortable disclosing) and have been on medication for many years (mood stabilizers). I do not struggle with depression **in general** despite a very dysfunctional family that causes 99% of my stress. I cope very well in day to day life, even through the 3 weeks where my dad was close to dying in hospital this year. I have a very positive outlook and maintain a normal job which I am very successful at. I am also in a wonderful romantic relationship for 2 years and have a good friendship circle. All the boxes are ticked. 
But this is where things go wrong. On a weekend I find myself in such a black hole and specifically on Sundays. I can barely move on a Sunday. Yesterday I spent the entire day in a fog, I was unpleasant to be around, I could barely talk to my partner and I honestly just wanted to sleep. This is rinse and repeat every week for as long as I can remember. Now I know what you're thinking, is it my job? I can honestly say that is impossible because I am very happy at my job, it virtually has no stress components to me and during the week I am in SUCH a good, happy, upbeat positive mood. I don't dread going to work.  I don't worry about work ever. I leave work and don't think about it again or  have to.
But bloody hell, Saturday rolls by and I often like death. Sunday comes and I am suicidal all over again.  I know Sunday blues is a thing and it has crossed my mind but I don't know how to cope or change this? I try and make plans for Sundays but no matter what I do, I feel exhausted, tired, drained, sad, depressed. I can have the best day planned will all my favorite things and still feel like crap. It sometimes is the same on a Saturday too. I wake up excited for the weekend and it is just... shit. But then during the week I'm so happy?
It's starting to make me act very irritated towards my partner and I cannot figure out how to change this. I'm in good shape. I exercise a lot. But this fog... it comes on a weekend and goes away Monday.",not depression,0

"How long do Mirtazapine side effects last? : [Throwaway account because my gf follows me]
My partner has just come off 2 months of 30mg mirtazapine for depression and anxiety, due to it not really helping, and because of the frustrating (mainly sexual) side effects (the usual, but far worse than other meds) that appeared as soon as she started taking it. 
This has obviously sucked for both of us, our sex life is nonexistent recently. Luckily we’re very open when it comes to things like this, so it didn’t cause any tension or frustration. 
I’m on sertraline and have been on other antidepressants, so I can empathise with what she’s feeling, but I’ve never been on mirtazapine, so my question to anyone with experience with this medication is:
Assuming you experienced similar problems, how long did it take for your sex drive to return, and were there any long term issues?

that was my young depression, but now, my depression is rising cuz i am not the man i want to be, and i cant change myself, i've tried, and what i get is others called me idiot, i cant think, and everyone is just know who am i,, i cant be the man i want, i tried going to gym, i've seen a lot of people who i want to become, but cant,

i tried acting like them,, but i failed, and i end up in a problem or some kind of ignore and judged,

I wish I could end my life without actually ending it. : I’m not sure if that makes any sense but I really want my life to end without it actually ending. I would never try to kill myself again because my daughter is my motivation to be alive I would never take myself away from her. But outside of her I am not happy. I try to stay positive and be happy but it’s just so hard. I feel like no matter what i do nothing is good enough and it’s just wrong. i’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend the father of my child for over 3 years. i know i’m not the only one that feels like i can’t do anything wrong or that i’m just a burden i think everyone feels that way about me. even my boyfriend said if i’m alone i won’t be able to deal with myself. I feel like i walk around with signs on my forehead that say “TREAT ME LIKE SHIT” “BE MEAN TO ME” “BE FAKE” “LIE TO ME” “CHEAT ON ME”. it’s like i attract all the fake people. i just sit at home with my daughter all the time i never go out anymore if i do it’s just to like go out to eat. i kind of miss when i was a freshman in high school and i thought i was the shit. people QUICKLY reminded me that i was not the shit at all and just in fact shit. i’m not sure what to do at this point as i try to feel good about myself but am constantly brought down by my boyfriend and parents. i feel like i’m not able to care about or focus on my own happiness and if i even try to for one second i’m called selfish. i try to make everyone happy and go a long with what they want because if i don’t things are just worse. i have had problems with depression since I was in 7th grade. at first my boyfriend was helping now it seems to just be making it worse. i feel like just a huge burden on society and that i shouldn’t have ever even been born in the first place.,not depression,0

"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, 

For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 

1st jan 2020 

I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different after

Ive never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don’t know how I can achieve that at this point. I’ve contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can’t do this alone. Therapists are expensive. 

I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. 

The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. 

Girlfriend

I’ve been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don’t want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. 

Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don’t know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO’s come up. 

I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don’t know them. It’ll never work and it doesn’t, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they’re not happy with their lives and marriage. They’re miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO’s. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don’t want this.  

The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. 

I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don’t want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. 


My own apartment

I still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It’s too much sometimes. I can’t go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. 

I have been wanting to move out all year but that’s not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don’t know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I’d rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I’m in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. 

Band

Music is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn’t have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  

I’ve always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. 

This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I’m not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. 

Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it’s a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. 

They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don’t do these kinds of things. It’s this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. 

I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn’t cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this. 

They’ve never given me a proper reason why they’re so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn’t want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It’s a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade. I will get there one way or another.",moderate,0
"Realised how ugly I must be. : I'm a guy... but it still hurts a lot. This week spent with family during Christmas and New Years has completely hammered home the fact that I'm ugly. Or, the ugly one in the family. And extended family.

I know I've always looked terrible in photos, but just seeing me in a bunch of them alongside my siblings and cousins this week, and seeing people on Facebook commenting about and complimenting them but ignoring my presence... it hurts, even though they didn't even say anything. It's just that I definitely know I don't look good, and it feels like everyone else is smart enough to know it too, which makes me shrink into my chair even more.

On top of that, my sisters were getting attention from different people all week. Again, I know how ridiculous I must sound typing this as a *guy*. But I already feel invisible and worthless enough as is in my life... and this week couldn't have made me feel anymore unwanted and alone, from family, friends and strangers alike.",moderate,0

"Depression or laziness? : For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 
Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.
Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time. This has been going on for at least a year or two and I really need to get work done and get on with my life so I don't fall behind. Any help would be appreciated :)",moderate,0
