"There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .",1
"Pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance .",4
"The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .",3

The film can depress you about life itself .,2
"The actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .",5
"This movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it .",3
What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is .,5
"Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .",2
"That rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults .",5
"Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .",4
A different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know .,4
"The plot is nothing but boilerplate clich√©s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times",1
"A movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well .",4
Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .,1
"Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .",3
It is a movie about passion .,3
"A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and a geriatric ` Scream . '",1
So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .,4
"The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .",2
"The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .",2
"The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .",3
"At once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .",5
"The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .",3
Each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .,3
"A passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .",3
"Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .",1
"Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .",3
Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .,3
