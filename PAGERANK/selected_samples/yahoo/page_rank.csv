"Title: A question about guys- Advice needed sooner rather than later?, Content: There is a guy at my play practice who is really nice and cute. He's one of the leads, and I'm in the chorus. We are in a lot of scenes together. I've known him for a few years now from previous plays, but it's been a really long time since I've seen him last. He's a year older than me- I'm fifteen, he's sixteen. We go to different schools. I really wanna be closer to him, but he has so many people around him all the time and I am kind of reserved (always with my two friends there). Any ideas? We all already have each other email's and numbers, so I can't ask him for either. Any advice or suggestions are loved. I don't know if I should just hang back and let him come to me, but do you think he ever will? Sometimes we catch each other's eye and then we both look away., Answer: Most people like to talk about themselves, give him a chance. If you're worried about his friends interfering or making you uncomfortable, send him an email. Ask for some personal info, but keep it friendly. This way, he doesn't feel like he has respond right away, and he might be nervous about talking to you in person.  The next time you meet in person you can talk in more detail things already mentioned in the message. It's like having a few conversation threads waiting in reserve.",Family & Relationships

"Title: Christians, what do you think about this dream I had last night?, Content: A man was driving west through Arizona on an interstate highway when he looked at his dashboard and saw he was almost out of gas.  There were no roadside stations in sight but he needed gas very soon.  The next exit was for a small town about 3 miles off the interstate so he took the exit to find gas.  It was a cold, wet, windy, winter day and as he traveled down the road to the little town he noticed a young man walking on the side of the road toward the interstate.  With little concern he traveled on to the town and filled up his tank.  \n\nAs he turned and drove back to the interstate he came upon the young  man again.  He was wearing a light jacket holding his arms close to his chest leaning forward into the freezing wind and rain obviously miserable and cold.  As the car approached the young man on the road he just barely put out his left thumb so as to indicate he needed a lift but trying to maintain some body heat.\n\nAs the driver passed by the young  man something inside him told him to stop.  He had never before stopped to pick up anyone like this before.  He brought his car to a stop about a quarter mile down the road from the young man.  As he turned to look back through the rear windshield he could see the young man running down the road toward his car.  Soon the young man was standing at the passenger door looking in the through the window the driver had lowered.  \n\n“I sure could use a lift,” said the young man.  The driver asked,  “which way do you need to go?”  The young man replied, “I need to go east.  Are you going that way?”  The driver hesitated for just a moment and then said, “Yeah.  I’m going east.  Get in.”\n\nThe young man almost jumped into the car.  His hair was covered in ice and with the warmth of the car it began to melt and drip from his hair.  As the driver pulled onto the road heading back to the highway he asked the young man, “where do you need to go?”  He replied, “I’m trying to get to my dad’s house in Virginia”.  The driver said, “That’s a long way to hitch hike don’t you think?  Why didn’t you call you dad and get some help getting back home?”\n\nThe young man replied, “ I haven’t talked to my dad in 5 years.  I left home on bad terms with him.  I was doing some things I new I shouldn’t do and dad didn’t approve.  So I left and said I’m never coming back.  Now I’ve lost my job.  I’ve lost my girl friend.  I have no money, no friends, and no place to live.  I don’t have anything left and nowhere to go.  I was afraid to call him. What if he said no I can’t come home?  Then what would I do?  Where would I go?  I thought if I can just make it back home maybe I can walk up and knock on his door.  Tell him how sorry I am.  Maybe he would let me come home.”\n\nThe driver pulled his car onto the interstate and headed east retracing the path from which he had just come.  The two continued to talk about what had happened in the young man’s life.  \n\nAs they drove and talked they soon came to a large city.  The driver without saying why began following the signs that showed the way to the airport.  The young man asked, “Where are we going.”  The driver responded, “I’m going to pay for a ticket for you to fly home.  You need to be with your dad.”  The two went into the airport together where the driver bought the ticket.  He handed it to the young man and said, “you’d better hurry you’re going to miss your flight.”  The young man hugged the driver and then with tears in his eyes he said, “You know, you didn’t have to do this, did you?”  \n\nThe driver paused for just a moment and looking back into the young man’s eyes responded, “ Yeah, I think I did.”\n\nI then found myself looking up a the crucified Jesus hanging on the cross looking down into my eyes.  I looked up at him acknowledging what He had done for me and with tears in my eyes I said, “You know, You didn’t have to do this, did You?”   \n\nJ, Answer: Very nice dream.  Thanks for posting it.  The representation in the dream is very good.  We the human family through rebellion and disobedience left our Heavenly Father, just like the boy in this dream left his father.  We then often find ourselves in dire situations, and want our Heavenly Father to forgive us and help us just like this boy did.  Jesus then, just like the kind man in this dream, paid the price and ticket to made possible for us to be forgiven and get back to our Father. \n\n Father forgive us and teach us that truth that sets us free (John 8:32).",Society & Culture

You used to see two white or black men putting on the roof.  Now you see 14 illegal aliens on a roof - all making below minimum wage.\n\nAnd most of their money gets sent back to Mexico.  That hurts the economy also.\n\nIllegals have put a real stand still on health care for millions of Americans.  I had cervical cancer while I lived in South Texas.  The doctor's office gave me an ""emergency"" appointment for 6 months away.  They couldn't see or treat me and the entire building was filled with illegal aliens and their 8 to 10 children.
