shooting actually practicing taking guns quick possible shooting target werent badly either university cops state cops armed better chicago police seems state cops every city suburban police officer ive seen around twin cities last two years carried semiauto type different brands though havent seen glocks regard discussion getting dangerously far usual rantings tpg close realm rg id like put two
