"I think I forgot how to exist : I’m just here. It’s Christmas, which normally I LOVE. I love snow, I love lights and all the weather, but I’ve felt so completely empty the past two months. I can feel my life moving and I feel like I’m not even seeing or feeling any of it. I’m just going through all the motions, and I’m starting to panic a bit because everybody is acting like this is completely normal. Like I keep telling them something is very wrong with me right now and no one believes me or sees anything wrong. I’m scared because I feel so disconnected from everything I used to love, including the people around me. I’m really stressed about it and I am not sure how to help this. I tried to get an appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist, but they couldn’t get me in until February. My counselor is overbooked because it’s at the university and she is always swamped. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",moderate
"I (16F) think i’m going to kill myself. : Everything is getting bad again, my trauma and body issues are resurfacing, my relationship is failing and it’s all my fault, i’ve lost my will to live, school is fucking awful (i’m getting bullied and the school couldn’t give less of a fuck), i’m so fucking stupid and depression is making it worse and i just don’t want to be alive anymore. 

Not even my family care about me, they wouldn’t even notice if i disappeared. My parents don’t even f*cking live with me anymore, i must of been such and awful kid that they had to get away. i mean it’s fair, it’s not like i deserve love or care. i wonder when my friends and family will notice that the suicidal jokes aren’t jokes anymore.

i hate myself so much, i keep thinking about all the dangerous situations i could put myself in that would make me suffer.

Every day i fantasise about killing myself. i can’t stop thinking about how easy it would be.

But i can’t kill myself yet, i don’t want anyone to miss me.

Who am i kidding? i probably not even depressed just seeking attention.",moderate
"I thought I had it under control : I've been feeling better, truly. I started taking my medication correctly, stopped drinking, started doing things I enjoyed. And then my life went to shit. My boyfriend and I broke up (we didn't love each other anymore), I moved farther away from my mom, I got into legal trouble, my grandmother suffered her 3rd stroke, I spent Thanksgiving alone. My grandmother almost died again. I spent Christmas alone. My ex got a new girlfriend, and I don't care much about that, but more about the fact that as a friend, I apparently no longer exist to him. I feel as though my family and friends are all so unreachable and nobody seems to understand when I tell them. I'm spending nye alone. 3 holidays in a row and I can shake this feeling that I'm slowly slipping back into old habits. I don't leave my bed if I don't have to work, I'm barely eating, and I let my room get a mess. I had a scary thought today. I've never been suicidal before, but today it sounded nice. I guess I don't have it as under control as I thought I did....",moderate
"a year later : it’s been a year since i’ve been out of a behavioral hospital. i went in because my depression got noticeably worse and i was going to kill myself. my roommates at the time took action and spoke to my counselor who had me see an emergency counselor and decided i should go to the behavioral hospital. i haven’t gotten better though. i’m just as sad as i was a year ago, possibly even worse. i feel like i’ve completely lost myself and like i can’t tell you who i am anymore. i feel like a toxic person in so many peoples lives and i’m just so tired. in the past month alone, i’ve attempted suicide about 3 times, but i’m scared when i actually get down to doing it. i’m just tired of being in pain. why can’t i be better? why can’t i be happy? i know i’m not the best person but i try to be nice, so how come i ended up this way? my body feels so heavy every morning, i just want a break. i want to either feel okay or not feel at all.",moderate
"All the things that used to help with my depression either no longer help now or have very minimum effect as I grow older, I have no idea what to do anymore, I am living with a lot of pain : Hello, I am 28M and I am living at a point where I am almost always extremely depressed, I have always had depression but it was never like this, I think for some reason it is now reaching some extreme levels that I don't think any fuckin human should endure. My life now is even better than it used to be before, I have a good career and I am away from abusive family. But things have only been getting worse and worse, and I don't have the courage to end my life, I am just stuck here and being tortured everyday. I am seeing both a therapist and a psychiatrist and both are not helping. medication is not fuckin helping either. The only thing that gives me any sort of momentary relief right now is talking to people who actually care, but I hate to keep bothering others with my shit, and I end up feeling more guilty to even ask for help because I feel so damn pathetic and weak. I truly have no idea what to do anymore and I believe that my brain is just way too damaged to keep going, but I can't fuckin kill myself because that would leave my family devastated. So it seems like I just have to keep on living for the sake of others as always, because as for me my life seems like it is already done and I do not have any passion for anything. 

in the past there used to be some things that I did that used to lift my mood up, now almost nothings works and I am constantly very depressed with no hope, no matter what I accomplish I can never be able to love myself, which is the reason why I think I am incapable of having a healthy relationship. I really don't know what to do anymore or why I am even writing this, I just need to get this stuff out of my head because I am really hurting.",moderate
"I really, really need hope right now... cutting again, twice these past two weeks. : I'm 20. I'm currently exiting a 4 and a half year relationship wherein I was mentally and physically abused. I abuse drugs sometimes to escape, pills and alcohol. I have no job, I quit my last one due to anxiety attacks. I just got academically dismissed from university because I dipped below a 2.0.

I have PTSD from my brother and my dad physically and mentally abusing me as well as serious bullying in middle school, I still live with them and they stopped but still treat me like shit. My mom was addicted to drugs for the last few years of her life and died of an overdose in front of me when I was 16, both grandfathers passed around then as well. My sister died in August.

I can't function. Therapy doesn't help, anti-depressants don't help, the only thing that helps is sleep, and I want to do that forever. I don't feel anything from music or video games or movies. I got kicked out of choir because I was ""there, but wasn't present"" (I was just going through the motions). Every important relationship in my life has been abusive. I have no friends. Every day I think about committing suicide, and I've been admitted twice and have called the suicide hotline multiple times. All I have are negative thoughts, the only thing I feel physically is a dry mouth, sweat palms and a pounding heart.

I just really want to do it so it all can stop. I just can't take it anymore.",moderate
"I’m stuck (18F) : It’s the first day of the new year and I don’t think I’ve felt more depressed in my life. I’m in college and have a 3 week break at home, and while it’s nice to have that break, I feel like shit in my hometown. It’s so depressing and just reminds me of how much I hated high school and how I had no friends. 
   Depression runs in my family, my Mom has it and my Dad is diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Not much of a surprise that I feel the same way (also they’re divorced). I’ve been feeling this way for about a year, since my second semester of senior year in high school. I don’t know how to explain it, like I’m definitely not bipolar but I seem to have a lot more ‘off’ days than I’d like. One thing, one moment just puts me off for the rest of the day. Being alone at school doesn’t help either, living in a single dorm and all. Like, I love having independence and doing my own thing but shit gets so depressing sometimes. School is the only thing I have to live for bc I get excited, I want to learn, being on campus gives me a sliver on hope for society. 
    I have 2 sisters (I’m the middle), and we’re all super close. I’m very close with my mom as well, and I’ve told them how I feel depressed (but I obviously can’t self-diagnose). My sisters support me through everything but I know they can’t fix my problems, just make life a little easier to live through. I’ve tried to have serious conversations about it with my Mom, but she just has so much on her plate everyday. My little sister was recently diagnosed with anxiety and started going to counseling again. We’ve seen symptoms when she was younger but it’s gotten worse. She’s attempted to hurt herself a couple of times and it breaks my heart. Since my older sister and I are at college and she’s home alone, I can only imagine what she’s going through. With that, I feel like my Mom doesn’t take me seriously. I’m always ‘overthinking it, being dramatic, or sensitive’. Usually one of her 3 responses to my ‘episodes’. 
     I want to seek help, idk if medication is the next step or what. Counseling sessions are booked at my school, idk how I’d be able to stay consistent with that while going to school. I just want someone to understand.",moderate
"Am I depressed? Need help. : Hello,

I’ve moved two years ago to a new country.

I was already feeling like shit the past months: apathy, getting drunk consecutively, feeling no energy, no belonging anywhere and not able to empathize and unable to sleep. Anger and revolt with myself and the ones around me...

I have a great girlfriend, a good job but I feel so bad about myself everyday, I actually started hating my self so much with no good reason.  Just want to be alone...Thought coming back home would help.

Coming back home for the holidays my house is a wreck: my grandmother just started to have Alzheimer’s (my birthday was actually the first day she didn’t recognized me), my father is totally depressed, my mother is also lost and I keep on passing the days alpathic with no action whatsoever, and for some reason I feel angry, revolted and aparhic...just to feel guilt afterwards ...I do t know how to react and I keep on being a jerk or at least feeling like one. I hate myself and I keep on feeling angry by the fact that I cannot properly react or act upon the shedding place my home and my mind has become...

I even thought about killing myself the past days but I think I really cannot...

Being away now for two years also provided me with a feeling of not belonging anywhere (I also left home and my hometown at 18 until 32)...so I really feel I cannot belong, I feel bad, feel ugly, feel sad, feel alone.

Am I becoming depressed and should I find some help? Or should I just try to do something about my atitude?

I always think about getting help but I am always afraid of the medication..I know it sounds ridiculous...

Thanks",moderate
"I'm tired of...lying to myself. : i'm sitting here alone downstairs as everyone already went to bed. because that's it, that was new years, and christmas, and christmas eve, and thanksgiving. all of it, the whole ""holiday season."" 

i'm kind of just tired of lying to myself. of forcing my brain to find shit to look forward to, anything to look forward to, to try to keep depression at bay.  but everything i look forward to eventually comes and passes. and it never feels as good as i told my brain it would. nothing is ever good. nothing ever feels good enough to make me happy. it's all just more things to go through. with more people. more drama to be around. more things to be anxious about. 

everything's a cloud of fucking depression and it has been since 2013. my teenage years are almost over and i can honestly say they've all been absolute fucking shit and hell. 

i'm never good enough and i know from here on out people will just expect more and more out of me. more work. maintain my 4.0. an actual job, and internships, and volunteering, shit i can't fucking do. 

i don't know. i don't know. i'm sitting here crying and i'm completely fucking alone and i feel all the tears in the back of my throat and i don't know how much longer i can lie to myself about things to look forward to that are all fake and fake happiness anyway. i can't do it again i can't keep this up.

"I’m not going to kill myself but... : I know I’m not making it in 2020. I can’t stop posting about my shit here. I’ve lost everyone who actually knew me. And I can’t stop being depressed. I can’t say I’m suicidal nor have suicidal thoughts because I don’t want to get sectioned. It’s unfortunate that I have to lie but I know my fate. Everyone is getting married, having kids, getting their careers, finding peace...I’m still not over my dads death. Nor the fact I got used, or the fact I was manipulated. But hey it was all me. I read the self help books and I know it’s my fault. Again I can’t kill myself but if i could, it would be for that reason. I’m not suicidal nor do I want to die, but I can’t get out of this downward spiral. I know there’s no hope no cure. Depression is situationally brought on. I wasn’t always this way but circumstances have brought me here. I’m not making sense since I’m just writing off the top of my head so I’ll stop now. I have tried to change based off of what my influencers tell me, off of what my therapist tells me, of what society tells me-and I’ve accepted I’m doomed.",moderate
"Feeling like I’m losing my battle : Ever since December was ending, I became more depressed and suicidal. Now every time I wake up, I’m upset that I’m awake. It makes me wonder if the depression medication I’m on... is actually making me feel more suicidal than I was before. It’s worrying me a little because it’s the new year and my will to live is fading. I feel like lately I have no energy. I’m more sensitive emotionally. I just want to lay in bed since video games doesn’t appeal to me as much as they use to. I can’t tell anyone my feelings because I have a hard time opening up. I haven’t started therapy because the therapist was booked and I won’t call the suicide hotline when I feel suicidal because I heard bad things about it. It just sucks that when I finally get help. I start the new year wanting to die x10000 more than I usually do.",moderate

"Everything has been feeling really hopeless for me : Over the last six months, I ended a 4-year relationship, moved across the country to a city where I know barely anyone, 2/3 of my pet rats died, and I'm having issues making friends. The few people that I've gotten slightly closer to have already bailed on being friends. I feel like I've really fucked up. I don't know if moving back to my old city would even fix anything.

I have no real hopes/goals for the future. I am not close to anyone in my family, I don't want kids, I don't really have a dream job or anything like that, and I am not focused/talented enough to make art etc. The only real thing I had been looking forward to was being in a good/deep relationship, but after my most recent relationship collapsed, I don't really feel like I believe anything will work anymore. I've turned to random hedonistic pursuits to try to make me feel better, but really they are just making me feel worse. 

I don't know what I'm really supposed to do from here. I'm already on antidepressants, but even through them I feel this way- but I suppose at least I no longer want to die? I just kind of feel numb. I have a list of things to do every day and I try to do them, but I really just want to shut myself in my apartment, read books, and never see anyone ever again. It's just really, really hard to believe it's gonna get better, you know?

School is really hard for me because of my depression, adhd, and anxiety so to deal with it every day on top of work is exhausting, but I don’t have any other choice. To my family, as long as I keep going I’m okay in their book, but keeping going like this is tearing at me and I fear that I’m going to fall apart soon.

"i was recently diagnosed with depression : Hello, as my titled says, I was recently diagnosed with depression. I don’t know where else to tell my story but I feel like I need to do it to prevent myself from doing something bad. I’m 18, I live in France and i’ve started going to college in September. Since then, I was feeling really off, as if I was some kind of second character in other people’s lives, but also in my own. I was feeling really lonely, but seeing my other friends feeling the same way reassured me in this feeling. However, as the time went by, I saw those same people gradually becoming better while I wasn’t, and I started losing contact with them. I used to be really friendly, always laughing and going out, while being really dedicated to my studies. Since then, it’s just as if everything just started becoming black. I’ve lost interest in going out, making jokes and laughing didn’t light the same sparkle in me, studying made me feel dumb and empty. I constantly feel like i’ve chosen the wrong path, but feel like i’m not good enough for another one, and i always wanted to come back to my parents but i wasn’t feeling right in my place anywhere. It started to became more and more frequent, with thoughts of quitting everything, or that I didn’t belong anywhere, etc. I didn’t want to go out anymore, or when I did, I just needed to drink to feel in a right headspace, or else I just felt as if I was standing aside of my own body, not knowing how to act or what to say to make believe that I was doing okay when really I wasn’t. I started to see my college’s psychologist but he really didn’t help me and instead made me feel really weird about myself and the way I felt. I spoke about it to my mother, which wasn’t that concerned because I hadn’t told her yet that I was thinking a lot about death and suicide. She helped me find a psychologist, which I started to see every week, since february. She immediately told me that she thought I had depression and needed to take medicine, and so I had to go see a psychiatrist to get them. With my psychologist, we talk a lot about my life in the past and how I could see the world as another point of view, and she makes me think of a lot of things about me, but really she just points out a lot of things that i do or am that kind of make me sad about myself. What really scared me is that I usually enjoyed a lot going to concerts, which made me really happy and the last two i went to made me feel so much anxiety and discomfort that I had to go out before the end. I was really disappointed towards myself. By then, I tried going to several places to find a psychiatrist but no one helped me or took me seriously and I felt like I would never be helped, and I felt like I didn’t really want to on the inside. I wrote a suicide note, and I was ready to try to kill me. My boyfriend saw it and he prevented my mother, which came by me crying saying she didn’t know I had the intention to do it. We went to a hospital to seek medical help but there were a lot of kids who were really sick and I didn’t feel at the right place at all. We finally found a psychiatrist, which diagnosed me with depression, and anxiety. She gave me meds that I have to take daily and are supposed to make me feel happy again. I hate it because everytime I want to swallow the entire pack, whether it is to die or get better quicker. I started questioning myself if I had always been depressed. I’ve always felt as if I wasn’t part of this world in some way, or that I didn’t deserve to be here.
Now, i’m not better at all but I like writing down my feelings. I’m living normally and i’m trying to do stuff to keep me occupied but i’m always bored because I always want to do something but I never know what; I’m vainly angry at people that love me because they love me; when i cross a crosswalk I always think of a car hitting me and then of me suffering; I always want to sleep to forget that im alive; When I laugh I feel like I shouldn’t be doing it; I feel like i’m not really depressed because my problems aren’t important; I feel like i’m useless and that I’ll never be important to anyone; I feel like my life is pointless and that it’ll never change; I feel like I should always excuse myself because I’m not a good person; I feel like the ugliest person in the world; and sometimes I just burst into tears because it is just too much and the weight is too heavy and I want to take it off. 
That’s my story dealing with depression. Everyday I wake up knowing that one day I’ll take my life away, but I want to get better; because people get hurt because of me. I’m hurting them because I deeply hate myself and I’m constantly fighting against myself. 
I hope i’ll get better.",severe
"Getting depressed over the new year : First of all I'd like to say I'm not diagnosed with depression, it's actually kinda rare I do get depressed. So maybe this is more of an upset feeling or something? Regardless, it's been getting to me. A few days ago making this post it was new years eve. I came home from Maryland to Pennsylvania for the holidays, and Christmas was nice. There was a small family party and I drank a little and made small talk and caught up with other people, then we all went our separate ways. Non of that bothered me. Then on new years eve, again I talked to the 2 other family members that showed up to my parents house along with me. We watched some tv, and it was nice again. But about an hour after everyone left and the house went dark I kinda just sat down and just started thinking. 10 years ago I was in 8th grade, was hanging out with after school, on christmas break, and was generally having a great time. Now I'm grown up, and dont really do much. I work, eat, do college work, play a little xbox or watch some tv, then sleep. Then repeat. Then I started thinking more how everything I used to have is gone. A lot of my friend moved and are gone, a lot of the shows I watched are off the air, places I went are gone, and places i used to go i cant anymore. Then it became clear how fast time went. It feels like yesterday I was on summer break, playing twisted metal on my ps1, my mom making chicken ramen in a pot, riding my bike up and down the street for hours, playing catch in the abandoned lot across the street, walking to my friends house to play gamecube, and standing out front of my house with my dad drinking a soda while him and his friends drank their beers. I started looking ahead after that. For my degree I'll be leaving country to work, most likely itll be around a 25 hours flight home then. So ill be leaving my home town further behind, so far to the point I cant make a week trip every now and then. More like a 2 week trip every year or 2 if I'm lucky. Not only leaving my town, also my childhood friends, family, house, places as well. My parents are getting older and people in my family are starting to die so I know that's coming. Its just.... wierd. I dont know if anyone else gets these feelings but this is a first for me. I wanted to go overseas to hopefully make a life there and have people from here come to visit and experience what it's like somewhere else, but it really really sucks knowing I'll be leaving my town behind. Even though it's a small town and theres honestly nothing to do and everything is really dated, its home, you know? My family's been in the area since the early 1900's and now here I am, feeling like I'm walking out on everyone. If anyone actually read this and made it to the end and has any advice or wants to talk, lemme know. My parents never had this problem, all my friends moved but not super far away, so they can always visit regularly, and my girlfriend has lived in like 7 different towns so she doesnt really understand the 23 years of attachment I have. I hope everyone has a wonderful new year, and if you do still live with family or close by make lots of memories and hold onto them, because you never know when that's all you'll have left of everything you once had.",moderate

"Can anyone relate. struggling : First time posting on reddit. yay 

Things in my life are getting to the point where it feels like a mountain of experiences are pressing me down and I feel like I can’t breathe or handle any stress without breaking down and crying all the time. I feel ok for short periods and then all of a sudden, whoosh - it’s like a wave knocks my feet out and pulls me underwater for hours and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve gone to therapy and most of the time I feel better for a couple hours afterward and then it goes right back to this dark heaviness. I feel hopeless and like I can’t relate to a lot of people in the city which is why I’ve temporary located back to this small town where I spent some time a few years ago..

highlight reel:

-mentally disabled older brother + emotionally unavailable/blocked parents (who never explained what was wrong with him until I asked when I was 14. We didn’t talk/hug/ate dinner maybe 4x/year together. lot of anger and talking behind each other’s backs since I can remember-mostly my dad doing this. 

-close family friend (like an uncle to me) drunk drove off a ridge and killed himself when I &amp; his son was 13 (close childhood friend) who then later accidentally killed himself of a meth overdose when we were 19/20 

-a year prior ^^ my best childhood friend was killed in a car accident and it felt like nobody I knew could relate 

-dislocated left shoulder 6 times over 7 years, had surgery when 16 &amp; 22, but the guy who did the first operation messed it up and screwed up my shoulder/drilled too much into my bone. felt like I didn’t have a say as my parents decided it at the time and I went into a super dark depression afterward. chronic pain in both shoulders and neck. feel like I’m 70 sometimes always thinking about my body  

-been sexually assaulted like 5 times, was held down and choked while someone came inside me in the back of a minivan. another time was roofied and woke up naked in a bed of a guy I had no clue who he was and how I got there, couldn’t remember anything. passed out drunk in my bed another time after party I organized at home and woke up to a friend’s friend having anal sex with me. etc. Recent turn of events has me reliving the most recent one and it makes me feel so worthless and like it’s all my fault esp since it was so painful and has affected me the most. sometimes I feel like I hate my body

-on that note I seem to keep attracting guys who aren’t patient or sensitive enough to take things slow and I keep getting hurt by things moving too fast even when I keep saying that I need gentle progression/mega trust first but I feel like I’m just continuing to lose hope at genuinely connecting with anyone. I get attention from guys who tell me I’m cute/smart but I feel so detached from my body, like cardboard. feel hopeless and scared to trust men

-I know I’m not fat but feel like I am always criticizing my body, I look in the mirror and see huge hips and I tell myself I’m “too big” and take up too much space and my butt’s not big enough, etc. From being told I was too skinny as a little girl and then gaining weight after 1st surgery. Troubling? thing is now I weigh 139, I’m 5’10, which means I haven’t weighed this little since I was like 14. I’ve been told multiple times by guys I’ve dated that I’m hot and sometimes I look at myself and think, whoa I’m super skinny what am I talking about, And then it goes right back to critic eyes and it seems like everything I wear makes me look huge. also, as a performer in college, I got a lot of feedback to be skinnier and it feels like it’s permanently affected how I see myself. Like it’s a good thing if I go a day without eating even though I know that’s not healthy. does anyone relate??

-survived a mass shooting at work this year and now I feel like the ptsd is making me insane. It got better and then it got worse. I’m scared to go out grocery shopping for too long, I couldn’t even go out tonight because of all the fireworks sound like gunshots and I still feel like I’m in a state of shock 

-Student debt’s only close to like $40k but I got an arts degree and now just feel screwed after having taken time off for this 2nd shoulder operation and feeling so insecure/doubting myself &amp; my abilities to do anything “productive” // “of worth” with my life. 

-climate change extinction you know the drill

Everything just feels pointless and I have such a lack of motivation to do most things. Even the littlest things take so much energy. I feel like I can’t even talk to people for extended periods of time because I just want to lie down or be alone

"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, 

For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 

1st jan 2020 

I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different after

Ive never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don’t know how I can achieve that at this point. I’ve contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can’t do this alone. Therapists are expensive. 

I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. 

The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. 

Girlfriend

I’ve been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don’t want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. 

Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don’t know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO’s come up. 

I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don’t know them. It’ll never work and it doesn’t, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they’re not happy with their lives and marriage. They’re miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO’s. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don’t want this.  

The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. 

I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don’t want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. 


My own apartment

I still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It’s too much sometimes. I can’t go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. 

I have been wanting to move out all year but that’s not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don’t know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I’d rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I’m in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. 

Band

Music is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn’t have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  

I’ve always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. 

This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I’m not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. 

Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it’s a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. 

They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don’t do these kinds of things. It’s this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. 

I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn’t cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this. 

They’ve never given me a proper reason why they’re so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn’t want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It’s a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade. I will get there one way or another.",moderate
"Forever Lost : (22F) I’ve had severe depression since I was 14 and going into 2020 I’ve just been hit with a massive wave of overwhelming dread. 

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I just need to let it out somewhere.

I’ve never posted before but this subreddit makes me feel some sort of comfort that I’m not alone in this. Thanks if you made it this far.

"I feel like killing myself would be the only to make my existence meaningful : 1) I feel like an asshole for admitting this, but I know my family and friends would suffer and I want them to. I feel like it's the only way to make anyone FEEL anything, that I'll be permanently in their memories if I do that, and that I'm just an afterthought if I continue living.

2) I feel like writing certain people suicide notes would be the only way I can express my feelings to them.

3)It feels like every day I'm upset I didn't kill myself yet. At every minor negative feeling, I'm like ""If I did that, I wouldn't be feeling this by now, I'd be feeling nothing by know, serves me right for being an idealistic fool and thinking things would improve"".

4) I just can't SEE a future. Nothing. Empty. I'm in my 20s, and it's like 30 year old me doesn't exist.
