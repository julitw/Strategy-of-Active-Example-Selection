1,"Title: How do you make a composite volcano erupt?, Content: simple ways for an erupton, Answer: Composite volcanoes typically form along subduction zones (ocean - continent plate boundaries).  They tend to have higher viscosity magma (andesite and dacite) which allows for more gas pressure to develop.  This produces more explosive eruptions.\n\nSome examples of subduction zones are the western coast of the USA and South America.  The Cascades and the Andes were and are currently being formed by subduction related processes.",Science & Mathematics

She also smokes and frequents motels whenever they have the chance. My wife doesn't like to do the talking, and passes the responsibility to me on how to deal with our daughter.  I need advice on what to do. Is someone here who have experienced these kind of problem? Please help., Answer: Man.  Good luck to you both.  I was a willful teenager too, and so was my sister - my poor parents!  They handled it well, though.  They always made sure I knew they loved me.  They invited the guys I knew around and got to know them and their families.  \n\nThe going to motels thing is scary - is that legal?  Could the motels get in trouble for allowing it?  If so, you could distribute a picture.  \n\nMake sure she knows the consequenses of sex, all the things that could happen to her if she continues - stds, pregnancy, etc.  Tell her how you feel about her having sex.  Be honest, but loving.  This is going to be difficult, but don't be affraid!  You can do it!\n\nThe smoking will be the hardest part - the only thing I can think of is to offer her treatment if she wants it.  \n\nIf she knows you love her and will always be there for her, she will feel safe with you and come back when her headstrong teenage years are over.",Family & Relationships

10,"Title: Who has some tips for getting power in a tennis serve?, Content: , Answer: Use as much of your body as you can - legs, back, shoulders.  Don't just toss the ball up, stand straight up, and swing your racket.  Instead, once you've tossed the ball crouch your body, bending at the knees AND the waist, as low as you reasonably can.  At the same time drop the shoulder of the arm that your racket is in as low as you can while keeping your toss arm up in the air (this will help you balance).  When the ball reaches the top of the toss, spring/uncoil your body by straighteing/uncoiling your lower body and at the same time bring your shoulder with the racket up and through the ball.  Notice ""through"", your follow through across your body is every bit as important to power (and accuracy).  Note - racket speed also has something to do with it but get this motion down first and once you've gotten comfortable with it you can work on doing it faster for even more speed.",Sports

What do you think would happen if Marcus Brutus was put on trial for Caesars murder or assassination. What would happen up on the stand? Give your opinion and an explaination on the answer you provide., Answer: Look at the elements of murder:\nMens Rea (intent, motive)\n(1) Purposely - Express purpose to commit a specific crime against a particular person\n\n(2) Knowingly - Knowledge that one's actions would certainly result in a crime against someone, but did not specifically intend to commit that crime against the particular victim which one is accused of injuring\n\n(3) Recklessly - Knew that one's actions had an unjustifiable risk of leading to a certain result, but did not care about that risk (""reckless disregard""), and acted anyway \n\n(4) Negligently - Did not intend to cause the result that happened, but failed to exercise a reasonable duty of care to prevent that result (which includes failing to become aware of the risk of that result) \n\nActus Reus -- the intended act of taking a life.\n\nTrials must PROVE both parts:  beyond reasonable doubt, did Brutus take Caesar's life intentionally?

18,"Title: How are the points scored in Nascar racing...?, Content: like Jimmy Johnson is leading in the points right now. Please explain., Answer: Ok I am a huge NASCAR fan and the point system is kind of confusing. But I am sure you can understand.The winner of each Nextel Cup race receives 180 points. The runner-up scores 170. From there, the point total declines in five-point increments for Nos. 2-6; points drop four points per driver for Nos. 7-11; and three-point increments separate drivers' points for finishers 12th place and lower.\n\nIn addition to the points allocated, any driver who leads a lap receives five bonus points. The driver who leads the most laps receives an additional five bonus points.\nIn Nextel Cup racing, following the 26th race of the season, all drivers in the top 10 -- and any others within 400 points of the leader -- earn a berth in the Chase for the Nextel Cup.\n\nAll drivers in the Chase will have their point totals adjusted. The first-place driver in the standings begins the Chase with 5,050 points; the second-place driver will start with 5,045, etc. Incremental five-point drops will continue through 10th place (5,005 points).\n\nIf more than 10 drivers qualify for the Chase, the additional drivers will have their points reset at 5,005.\n\n• Owners are rewarded in the points race in much the same fashion but, unlike drivers, they earn points for merely attempting to make a race. If an owner shows up with two drivers and one fails to qualify, the owner still receives points for the non-qualifying effort.\n\nThrough the first five races of the season, the top 35 in owners' points from the previous season are guaranteed a starting spot in the race. Beginning with the sixth race, the top 35 in current owners' points are guaranteed a spot.\n\nThe fastest non-qualifier on race day earns 31 points for his owner, three down from the 43rd-place points. The scale continues downward for all non-qualifiers, with the lowest possible point awarded being one.\n\n• Manufacturers have a points race of their own. The car maker who has a driver take first place in a race earns nine points for that race. Second-best performance by a manufacturer gets six points, third place earns four points and fourth place, three points\nRace Points System \nFinish Points   Finish Points",Sports

26,"Title: I need to know about Greece from 3000B.C. -146B.C.?, Content: , Answer: The history of Greece began with the Stone Age hunters and early farmers. This time period was followed by the civilizations of the Minoan and Mycenaean kings. Next came the Dark Ages which was a time period characterized by many wars and invasions. Greece was then invaded by the Dorians in approximately 1100 BC. Finally, in the period from 500-336 BC Greece was divided into small city states. A city-state consisted of a city and its surrounding countryside. \n\n\nChronology\n\n6000 - 2900 BC Neolithic Period \n2900-2000 BC Early Bronze Age \n2000-1400 BC Minoan Age \n1600-1100 BC Mycenaean Age \n1100-750 BC The Dark Ages \n750-500 BC Archaic Period \n500-336 BC Classical Period \n336-146 BC Hellenistic Period \n\n\nhttp://www.cedarville.edu/academics/education/resource/schools/chca/othergrades/greecetd/greece1.htm\n--------------\n3000 BC In early Bronze Age settlers from Asia Minor came to the island and fused with earlier Neolithic occupants to develop what is known as the Early Cycladic culture. They worked in marble and stone and traded over sea.\n\n1600 BC During the Late Bronze Age Siphnos was under the cultural andcommercial hegemony of the Minoans of Crete. It is believed that theCretans founded the town named Minoa but remains are as yet undiscovered.\n\nIn 1400 BC the explosion of Santorini destroyed the major centers of Minoan civilization the Mycenaeans became the dominant power in the area and used the islands as relay staions to the near east, replacing many of the indigenous people with Greeks.\n\nAt about 1100 BC during the dark days of the Dorian Invasion, Sifnos was colonized by Ionians from Attika, led by their chieftan Alkenor who became the islands first sovereign.\n\nIn the 8th century BC Greeks began to think of themselves as an ethnic unity. City States began to grow up on the mainland and the islands. Sifnos was under the domination of neighboring Milos. It was then that Gold was discovered on the island and the inhabitants became quite rich, paving their capital in Parian Marble and building a treasury in Delphi. It was said that every year the Sifniots would present a solid golden egg to the God Apollo. One year out of guilt they gave him an egg that was merely plated in Gold. The angry God destroyed their mines. It was also during this period that Samian pirates plundered the island. With the riches they took, they aquired the island of Hydra for their home. When the mines of Sifnos brought forth no more precious metal the island was reduced to poverty.\n\nIn the fifth century BC Sifnos was part of the Greek alliance of City states that defeated the Persians at Marathon, Salamis and Platea. Sifnos became a part of the Delian League and came under the authority of Athens. During the Peleponisian wars, Sifnos managed to stay out of the conflict. In 338 it fell under the influence of Phillip of Macedonia. When Persians captured it in 332 Alexander the Great sent a squadron to expell them. When Alexander died and the empire was devided among his generals, Sifnos fell under the influence of the Ptolemies of Egypt until 146bc when they fell to the Romans.\n\nhttp://www.greektravel.com/sifnos/history.htm",Education & Reference

59,"Title: When  americans are looking for jobs why do we have to be bilingual? Shouldn't  the immigrants speak english?, Content: Everytime I find a job that I qualify for I can't apply because they want you  to be bilingual. I believe the immigrants should speak english if they live here in the USA not us speaking there language. \nIf they want to speak there language then they should do it in there home not at the work place or in public business. \nI am not prejudice but it makes me mad when they live here in the USA and they want us to speak there language and they cant speak english., Answer: HELLLOOOOO??? Am I the only American answering this question??? I was born here and I have lived here my whole life and I ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT have to learn another language to communicate with people in MY OWN COUNTRY! If I moved to India or S. America or Mexico or whatever I would not expect people to learn English so I would feel at home and comfortable! I would not move there until I knew at least the minimum appropriate language to speak to the people of that land with respect. If you go to another country at least have respect enough for the people of that land to learn thier language...and maybe even a bit about thier history. I understand that people come here to get away from poverty and find a better life, I don't disagree with the USA giving that to them but as far as not being able to afford to learn English...that's a crock! It's spoken everday all day everywhere you go! Your kids go to school and learn and are taught in English.....learn from them! To say that someone is unqualified for a job because they only speak the language of the country in which they live speaks that is the dumbest and stuck - up thing I have ever heard!! Just like Gearge Carlin says...""If you are going to take my order of french fries and a double cheeseburger, do it in English"" PERIOD! I am living proof of respect for people in those countries...just so you know I am not talking ""out of the side of my neck"" I was actually thinking about moving to Italy and in the process of researching that option I also looked up a few local places where I could take basic Italian. It's just respect for the country in which you live to learn the language....not ask the country to learn yours!!\n\n\nP.S.......blondie....a mispell does not mean that someone does not know english...and stereotyping is probably not in your best interest...I mean you are a blonde!!",Politics & Government
