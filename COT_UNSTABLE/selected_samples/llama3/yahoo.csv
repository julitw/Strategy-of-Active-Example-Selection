First, I'll address your question.  The truth is I have no idea, but who cares?  South Park is the best show ever made, but with all that time off, Trey Parker and Matt stone have time to bring us other things, such as Team America!!\n\nAnyway, it's not because animated shows take a long time to create; it only takes the SP crew six days from start to finish.  This is because every little detail is done in-house.  Family guy, for example, has to ship its work off to Korea, where it is animated.  \n\nAlso, the animation doesn't ""suck;"" they use state-of-the-art animation software; it looks the way it does because that's part of the charm.\n\nFinally, I just want to give a quick shout-out to all the South Park haters out there who think the show is stupid just because they make fun of everyone.  RELAX!!!  I was a hurricane Rita victim last year, and it really made my entire year when they made fun of the entire situation.  They did a wonderful job.  Besides, with idiots like Tom Cruise running around doing idiodic publicity stunts such as conforming to celebrity scientology fad and jumping around on Oprah's couch, we need someone to speak up, because while everyone else knows how stupid Tom Cruise is, the media is too chicken to say anything.",Entertainment & Music
