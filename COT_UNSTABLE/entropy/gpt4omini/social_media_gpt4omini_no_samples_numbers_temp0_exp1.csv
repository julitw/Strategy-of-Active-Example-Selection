1,"Depression or laziness? : For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 
Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.
Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time.

6,"I don't pray : I grew up in a very christian household, we had good times for a while but then when it got bad it got bad. There was emotional and verbal abuses, alcoholism and plenty of other grievances to fall back onto to blame for my mental health in life after. But through all that my mother was there, she supported me and cared for me when I couldn't or didn't know how, she would call me her rock because I kept her happy calm and stable.

But as time has gone on I've realized she was much more mine than I hers. I've struggled with depression since I was 6 years old and thoughts of suicide since 11, I'm 28 now and through all these years my mom has been there for me.

This last year I got my heart broken, lost pets, my job but she was always there for me throughout. Ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay, that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right.

I wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren, buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden. I wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but I failed that.

I took my time, telling myself there was plenty and I'd do it all some day.

My mom died three weeks ago. There was no hints or build up, she was healthy one day and then I woke up into a dream I couldn't fall asleep in. My family is small, group of friends even smaller. As the days passed I took note of how many left my sphere, close friends I was there for are nowhere to be found.

I lost religion a long time ago, I don't pray. But I prayed in that hospital, the hours waiting outside during surgery. I promised I'd be better, I promised I'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days. I cried and begged and pleaded.

And it all went unanswered. I felt like a fool, she would have never wanted me on my knees like that but I had to try and try I did.

12,"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, 

For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 

1st jan 2020 

I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different after

Ive never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don’t know how I can achieve that at this point. I’ve contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can’t do this alone. Therapists are expensive. 

I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. 

The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. 

Girlfriend

I’ve been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don’t want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. 

Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don’t know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO’s come up. 

I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don’t know them. It’ll never work and it doesn’t, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they’re not happy with their lives and marriage. They’re miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO’s. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don’t want this.  

The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. 

I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don’t want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. 


My own apartment

I still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It’s too much sometimes. I can’t go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. 

I have been wanting to move out all year but that’s not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don’t know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I’d rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I’m in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. 

Band

Music is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn’t have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  

I’ve always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. 

This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I’m not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. 

Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it’s a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. 

They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don’t do these kinds of things. It’s this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. 

I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn’t cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this. 

They’ve never given me a proper reason why they’re so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn’t want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It’s a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade.

14,"I hate myself so much that it spreads around me at times : Hi,

Before I begin, I am sorry for my language skills, it isn't my native tongue and I am not the best writer. This is the first time I express myself. I have nobody else but here.

  
In my country at schools retakes are once a year at the end of academic semesters where one retake can make you pass or fail the whole year. Until university I always slacked around and was practicing programming. At the end of each academic year I would attend all retakes and pass with C or above. However, we had those meetings where teachers would give feedback about us to our parents. And teachers always said ""Kuzenet is very kind and quiet. He is a nice boy, maybe the nicest in the class but he doesn't study at all."" These words would render my mother super angry. Every time she is back from those meetings I would get yelled at and my mother would cry every time. I am very sensitive and it was very damaging for me. Not to mention i did get beaten up a couple of times due to my mother's anger. My father would make his grumpy face - i would rather prefer someone torturing me instead of seeing him like that for months. He would never talk to me with a happy and welcoming tone. I could tell he wants me to go away as soon as possible his sentence is over from his tone. By the time my parents get better, another meeting would happen and all would reset. This loop begun in primary school until the end of high school.  


The reason why I mention this is because, now I feel incredibly inferior although I got scholarship and a part time engineering job. I feel very stupid at work and at university as well. Especially because the fact that I started university a lot later than my peers. I have no friends, literally zero. People only text me when they need help with assignments or when they study for exams. People I helped gave me nice feedback all the time about how their grades improved thanks to my assistance and all. No friends from that either. I pick foods that don't damage your brain but I love chocolate and every time I eat chocolate I feel very guilty thinking the sugar will dampen my cognitive abilities once sugar levels go down. All I wanted was friends that I can listen to, text with, read their messages. My phone doesn't function well for the past year and I didn't get a new one because there is no use for it in my life.  


I read a lot of suggestions online about going to rock climbing or something like that, but I am not into that and besides, I am living abroad. It is really hard to make any friends when you are a foreigner even if you are a fit in their culture just because you don't know the language that well. There is also the fact that some people don't like the country I came there from. They have assumptions about people from there and they avoid me at first. I do not put in the effort of proving them I am worth their time because I also don't think I am a great person either. I am only good at solving problems when people have one. Other than that, I don't know what to do.  


This consistent anger at myself being stupid and incompetent makes me short tempered at my parents. When I visit them I get easily annoyed. Today I made my father upset, I am very afraid of losing my parents as I think as people age they can't endure sadness or stress well and each time they are upset, I get 10x more depressed at least. My hatred towards myself is just adding up. This ends up being a infinite loop.  


I remember I was a very happy kid but nowadays nothing makes me happy. This has been going on for about 8 years. Everything is black and white. I attract no-one, I don't look into mirror for the past 8 years and I overthink everything.  


I hate myself to the fullest and I can't forgive how many times I made my parents upset. I failed a business before starting university due to third-party conditions. It wasn't my fault but still, I am the one who caused a loss. While I am not considering suicide because I can't do that to my parents, I don't feel alive at all.

20,"Don’t ruin your body : In the last third of 2019 I’ve fallen so low I’ve never fallen before. Day to day thinking of suicide, feeling worthless and unlovable, etc. I fell deeper than when my mother died from cancer. Now I have a job and I’m an adult who lives alone which allowed me to abuse stuff: alcohol, painkillers, antidepressants, cocaine, weed. I’ve done everything to feel just a bit numb or happy at least for a few minutes or hours.

Recently I started getting better slowly, day by day. One day I hit the low again. I sat home and I was about to open a bottle of whisky and do some lines of coke then a random thought came through my mind:

Depression ends or pauses eventually. For 7 years I was not that depressed. If I keep doing drugs and alcohol and abuse my body I might ruin it by the time my life gets better.


What if your life suddenly takes a complete 180, you find the love of your life, you get kids, you get a great job and you don’t get to experience those things for long because when you hit a low point a few years back your body took a toll that can’t be repaired.

23,"Severe depression on weekends but not during week, at wit's end? Stealing all my joy. : Hi all.
I'm 26, have a diagnosed mental disorder (I feel uncomfortable disclosing) and have been on medication for many years (mood stabilizers). I do not struggle with depression **in general** despite a very dysfunctional family that causes 99% of my stress. I cope very well in day to day life, even through the 3 weeks where my dad was close to dying in hospital this year. I have a very positive outlook and maintain a normal job which I am very successful at. I am also in a wonderful romantic relationship for 2 years and have a good friendship circle. All the boxes are ticked. 
But this is where things go wrong. On a weekend I find myself in such a black hole and specifically on Sundays. I can barely move on a Sunday. Yesterday I spent the entire day in a fog, I was unpleasant to be around, I could barely talk to my partner and I honestly just wanted to sleep.

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can’t let go and I feel like a creep (still “friends”)- still held on a “string” but he doesn’t seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

37,Selenium and Magnesium can help a lot with depression : I have depression myself it’s been very severe for a while but I’ve done research on what causes the chemical imbalances and how to fix them as well as what else is wrong. Mercury seems to be the main cause of depression and all mental illness but Selenium and Magnesium can get rid of it over the course of months. These two minerals are both antioxidants themselves and also both increase Glutathione which is the most important antioxidant in the body. Antioxidants fight oxidative a which is a major factor in depression. Selenium also increases metallothionein which is crucial for a good blood-brain barrier and protection from heavy metals. I’m taking these right now although only recently started but I just wanted to tell whoever sees this that there are a lot of different supplements that can help immensely with depression because they help the body deal with what’s wrong and what’s lacking. I highly recommend anybody struggling like me to start taking these two supplements it can’t hurt it can help a lot it could even cure your depression if it is from mercury toxicity like it is a lot of the time.,severe,3.189147364877366e-07

41,"Don’t ruin your body : In the last third of 2019 I’ve fallen so low I’ve never fallen before. Day to day thinking of suicide, feeling worthless and unlovable, etc. I fell deeper than when my mother died from cancer. Now I have a job and I’m an adult who lives alone which allowed me to abuse stuff: alcohol, painkillers, antidepressants, cocaine, weed. I’ve done everything to feel just a bit numb or happy at least for a few minutes or hours.

Recently I started getting better slowly, day by day. One day I hit the low again. I sat home and I was about to open a bottle of whisky and do some lines of coke then a random thought came through my mind:

Depression ends or pauses eventually. For 7 years I was not that depressed. If I keep doing drugs and alcohol and abuse my body I might ruin it by the time my life gets better.


What if your life suddenly takes a complete 180, you find the love of your life, you get kids, you get a great job and you don’t get to experience those things for long because when you hit a low point a few years back your body took a toll that can’t be repaired. I don’t want to die on my future wife and kids in my 30s or 40s. If I get those things I want, I want to experience it for a lot of time and without health related complications.

I've  never posted something like this, but for once I've no one, nowhere and  not even the will to reach out in my personal life anymore. I have  nowhere else to turn.
I had a  psychiatry appointment today, one I've been waiting for for uite a  while, you could say I've been waiting nearly a year since being told  I'd be put straight into another mental health service and wouldn't be  left alone out in the deep end. You can probably guess where this  story's going.
The psychiatrist  heading the community service that I was in until this morning decided  to discharge me, against my wishes. She didn't allow me to speak in the  appointment. When I could get a few words in she would cut me off. She  wrote off some points that I wanted to bring up as simple personality  traits and that I can't compare myself to others, that each person is  different. Well if it were that simple I wouldn't be in the services.  She said that I shouldn't strive to label myself or something when I  brought up that I suspect I've autism. No matter how many times I said  how it's getting more and more difficult to exist in day to day life  with others I wasn't listened to.
She  told me what I thought, or what I went through. I said my last  psychiatrist dismissed a lot my issues. She said that he didn't, even  though these are two completely different services. This doctor in  particular stated that I don't have depression and the source of most of  my issues is me over exaggerating things in my head. Never got to say  that because she wasn't interested in listening to me.
From  the beginning she had an opinion of me that I felt like I was going to  have to fight against, and she never let go of it, leading her to  finally discharge me. She said that I don't appear to like the service,  that it's not beneficial, that I'm not happy with it and that I always  had something to say about it. From the beginning of my attendance to  this service I was never entirely sure of how I was being deal with. I  had a main appointment at the beginning where she had to get to know me  and my history. I was at the end of my rope at that point in my life due  to trying to finish school and being in an abusive relationship where I  was gaslit into thinking I was an awful broken person. I had very few,  maybe 2 max I think, ""check in"" appointments later where 2 different  doctors did just that, check in on me and asking basic uestions to write  down the answers to in my file. At these points in my life I was  cripplingly depressed, had no idea what was going on at all due to, yk,  trauma. My head was beyond broken and I couldn't articulate much other  than ""I feel terrible"" in those appointments. Today she backtracked on  those check-ins, that they were proper meetings, that I didn't like the  service sure I can't even make sense of what she said now as I'm writing  this. I had no appointment during the next period of my life where I  genuinely just wanted to do away with myself which is a sentiment that  has yet to leave me and has been massively exasperated from today.  One  of the doctor's even said in the meetings I've had before that there was  nothing he could really help me with because he didn't know me, that it  was a bit pointless to be doing mindfulness exercises, that he didn't  believe in half that shit. The other doctor ended up hugging me at the  end of our meeting because I was so fucking depressing. And today there  was this bitch again.
Apologies if the above paragraph isn't all that clear, I'm truly confused as to what my situation is too.
She  told me that I have no mental illnesses and cut me off whenever I tried  to say that I had no official diagnosis', just recommendations and  screenings because I never got the time of day anywhere. The only chance  that I had originally was the last psychiatrist that demeaned me. She  replied to me in these exact words: ""We're doctors, not imbeciles. These  doctors haven't found anything in you before. They would've seen  something if there was."" I had two check in appointments and that was  it. She also said that I've already been diagnosed with aspergers. I  haven't been, the child health service said it was a likely possibility  and wrote a recommendation about it in my file. I was seen very little  times because I was over 18 when they finally saw me. They told me  explicitly that this wasn't an official diagnosis. If it was, my  previous service would have known. She refused to listen and rejected  that.
I  began tearing up at some point, leading to full blown sobbing in the  end, to which her only response was (at the door to the office) \[name\]  come on, I have to move on to the next person.
I  broke down crying on the floor of the toilet inside. I couldn't go out  in public in that condition. This is possibly the lowest I've felt since  I: 1: Was left on the floor of my abusive ex boyfriend's floor to curl  into a fetal position and cry, and 2: Crying in the school bathroom and  cutting my arm after being demeaned by my principal for the sin of  reaching out for help.

52,"ive been contemplating taking my own life : and im posting this here because i know i dont have the nuts to go through with it. 
Im an eighteen year old who struggles with a circuit board of mental issues. 
life is so confusing and anxiety inducing
When i was little, i wanted to grow up to be an animator, i loved watching shows and drawing, i found most of my creative output came in drawing. 


Last week, my portfolio was rejected. 
I had spent months, almost a year on my portfolio. Drawing, scrapping, crying, tearing, repeat. 
I had taken a few months to gather money for college, and i havent had the heart to tell my mom i didnt get in. 
I havent told my mom things in a long time, and i lie to her about my mental health. The amount of times ive held a knife and contemplated just slitting my throat open or holding all my night medication and downing it in one go before going to sleep shocks me sometimes. 
Its almost a daily thing, an hourly thing. With every action i do i think of a way to off myself on the spot. 

And the only thing keeping me from doing it is the time i told my dad i was having suicidal thoughts, and he broke down crying saying he is afraid to come home one day from work to find his youngest daughter dead. 
And that he couldve been home to prevent it.

And when in 2013, when my cousins died in a plane crash, my mom was devastated, she wouldnt stop crying, my dad had to restrain her, and i just started crying because i was so confused. Those are her niece and nephew but what about her Daughter? 
I may not get along with my mom, but i still love her too much to put her through that pain. 
My dogs would be so confused, my cat would curl up on my bed wondering when id come back. 

My depression sucks ass, and i cry constantly, and i hate my life and my lifestyle. 
But i would never do anything about it.",moderate,1.5965108980732487e-07

Ive been clean and sober for almost 4 months. This is my 3rd time in rehab and im getting out a week from today. 
I moved out of state for treatment and am staying where im currently at. I have no friends or family here. I feel so alone. My last attempts at getting sober always failed because of my depression and lonliness. 
The reason im so depressed and lonley is due to one large reason. I want a relationship with a woman more than anything. It drives me absolutely insane because i feel like im shit and no one would ever love me. I havent been in a relationship since the end of highschool and it makes me so sad. And the fact i care so much about it makes me feel like a pathetix loser. There is a girl in treatment with me that i really hit it off with and for the first time i felt some sort of happiness because i thought maybe id have someone to go through this hell with finally. But a week ago she told me she just wants to be friends ""for now."" Whatever that means. Pretty sure she was just tryna be nice after leading me on super hard.

What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even.

I’ve got a primary doctor picked out (haven’t had one in like five years) and a therapist picked out. I just can’t work up the guts to make the appointments. I’m absolutely terrified that I’ll talk to the doctor about it and they’ll deny me getting antidepressants and that therapy won’t help. If I try and it fails then that’s the final nail in the coffin, there’s no hope because I tried so much already. 

And there’s the looming possible weight gain. I’m 5’3” female and 205lbs. I went from a very fit 142lbs (26% body fat) in 2015 to 205lbs (42% body fat) and out of shape now. I know how to eat well and I love exercising but I just can’t anymore. I despise how I look already so being super depressed sounds better than continuing to gain weight.

Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother?

I was not expecting much because she is the only person I really knew there and I am not very good with meeting new people. But surprisingly I was having fun and talked to a bunch of people and even started conversations (!!!). I guess the alcohol helped a bit... 

When I got home I was really proud of myself for going to the party and especially talking to people and not sitting in a corner quietly. The feeling of making progress gave me a little confidence boost.

Fast forward to now. When I think back I feel like I was putting on a mask so I look like I am a social and fun person. Thinking about those conversations really makes me cringe because now they feel so fake and pointless. Like I was just having them to have a smooth, non-awkward evening and staying in my ""party persona"". 

I get the same feeling when I think about times where I opened up to my 2 best friends about having mental problems.

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate,2.4012340166872005e-08

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

I arrive, thank the host, bla bla. First hour or two im just chilling with the guy who was gonna leave. I get a beer, and drink most of it (my friend left after) and socially im doing better than i thought i would. Im having ""fun"". Few shots later still having fun. I had seemed to have hit it off with a girl who was single (spoiler shes the one night). Midnight comes and i drink like 3-4 glasses of champagne. I lie down --&gt; im drunk. 

After i get drunk i get loudish/talkative and just generally say whatever comes to my mind, including secrets/insecurities/depression. So my friend and the girl babysit me cause i cant walk in a straight line. And i start ranting on and on about my problems (mom's cancer, depression, choking myself, etc.). I think i cuddled the girl, but she stopped cause she wanted me to be sober while doing stuff. After that she took me on a walk so i could get fresh air. After which i started to hug her (vigorously) in front of my friend. 

Since this was also a sleepover me and her slept in the guest room. By this time i was kinda sober. I started to cuddle her which lead to making out and groping, but she stopped from going further cause again i was still kinda drunk and she just met me. The rest of the night we just cuddled. 

After we woke up she went to her friends. I was sober by this point which meant i went from confident social guy to depressed anti social guy. 
We talked a bit about why i was being antisocial, cuddled a bit more, i got her number and hugged for a really long time before i left.

After which i felt like shit not from the booze but just from the emptiness. I want to meet her again, but im scared that she'll get bored of the real me, the antisocial depressed me. She knew the drunk me, not the real one. Im also scared i'll hurt her physically or verbally, due to my depression and my previous relationship where i hurt the other person by ignoring her asking me out for over a year, even though she knew i knew.

Things in my life are getting to the point where it feels like a mountain of experiences are pressing me down and I feel like I can’t breathe or handle any stress without breaking down and crying all the time. I feel ok for short periods and then all of a sudden, whoosh - it’s like a wave knocks my feet out and pulls me underwater for hours and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve gone to therapy and most of the time I feel better for a couple hours afterward and then it goes right back to this dark heaviness. I feel hopeless and like I can’t relate to a lot of people in the city which is why I’ve temporary located back to this small town where I spent some time a few years ago..

highlight reel:

-mentally disabled older brother + emotionally unavailable/blocked parents (who never explained what was wrong with him until I asked when I was 14. We didn’t talk/hug/ate dinner maybe 4x/year together. lot of anger and talking behind each other’s backs since I can remember-mostly my dad doing this. 

-close family friend (like an uncle to me) drunk drove off a ridge and killed himself when I &amp; his son was 13 (close childhood friend) who then later accidentally killed himself of a meth overdose when we were 19/20 

-a year prior ^^ my best childhood friend was killed in a car accident and it felt like nobody I knew could relate 

-dislocated left shoulder 6 times over 7 years, had surgery when 16 &amp; 22, but the guy who did the first operation messed it up and screwed up my shoulder/drilled too much into my bone. felt like I didn’t have a say as my parents decided it at the time and I went into a super dark depression afterward. chronic pain in both shoulders and neck. feel like I’m 70 sometimes always thinking about my body  

-been sexually assaulted like 5 times, was held down and choked while someone came inside me in the back of a minivan. another time was roofied and woke up naked in a bed of a guy I had no clue who he was and how I got there, couldn’t remember anything. passed out drunk in my bed another time after party I organized at home and woke up to a friend’s friend having anal sex with me. etc. Recent turn of events has me reliving the most recent one and it makes me feel so worthless and like it’s all my fault esp since it was so painful and has affected me the most. sometimes I feel like I hate my body

-on that note I seem to keep attracting guys who aren’t patient or sensitive enough to take things slow and I keep getting hurt by things moving too fast even when I keep saying that I need gentle progression/mega trust first but I feel like I’m just continuing to lose hope at genuinely connecting with anyone. I get attention from guys who tell me I’m cute/smart but I feel so detached from my body, like cardboard. feel hopeless and scared to trust men

-I know I’m not fat but feel like I am always criticizing my body, I look in the mirror and see huge hips and I tell myself I’m “too big” and take up too much space and my butt’s not big enough, etc. From being told I was too skinny as a little girl and then gaining weight after 1st surgery. Troubling? thing is now I weigh 139, I’m 5’10, which means I haven’t weighed this little since I was like 14. I’ve been told multiple times by guys I’ve dated that I’m hot and sometimes I look at myself and think, whoa I’m super skinny what am I talking about, And then it goes right back to critic eyes and it seems like everything I wear makes me look huge. also, as a performer in college, I got a lot of feedback to be skinnier and it feels like it’s permanently affected how I see myself. Like it’s a good thing if I go a day without eating even though I know that’s not healthy. does anyone relate??

-survived a mass shooting at work this year and now I feel like the ptsd is making me insane. It got better and then it got worse. I’m scared to go out grocery shopping for too long, I couldn’t even go out tonight because of all the fireworks sound like gunshots and I still feel like I’m in a state of shock 

-Student debt’s only close to like $40k but I got an arts degree and now just feel screwed after having taken time off for this 2nd shoulder operation and feeling so insecure/doubting myself &amp; my abilities to do anything “productive” // “of worth” with my life. 

-climate change extinction you know the drill

Everything just feels pointless and I have such a lack of motivation to do most things. Even the littlest things take so much energy. I feel like I can’t even talk to people for extended periods of time because I just want to lie down or be alone

Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state.

183,"19, Gay, Lonely and Bitter :        First post on reddit so this'll probably be a bit worse than it maybe would normally be. 
    First of all, I'm a 19 year old gay guy om my last semester in college before transfering to a new college. I've been single my whole life and honestly at this point the feeling of loneliness is eating me up. I can't watch gay couples be happy anymore because it makes me feel so bitter and jealous that I dont have what they have and they I'm going to lose out on the teenage gay dates that I dreamed about in high school. Recently, I managed to ask out a guy I was interested in recently (he said i wasnt his type) and I thought this would be a huge step towards progress but now I feel like there's no one left. 
     To be clear, I'm glad I asked him out. I feel now like I can move on and not stay stuck on him like I have with other guys. But college is so much less social than high school was for me and I feel like there isnt anyone out there for me to date. At least no one I'd be able to date in the few months I have before transfering.
      My loneliness has become worse recently because I stopped talking to my best friend. We got in a fight after I told her I asked someone out and how much my loneliness has been hurting me. I felt like I had to stop talking to her because it hurt having a conversation with someone about feeling how deeply painful this loneliness I'm feeling is when they're in a 2 year long relationship and living with their boyfriend and raising a dog. How do you tell someone that the reason it hurts to be unloved by anyone is because you cant even comprehend being loved in the first place?
      I dont know how to explain this loneliness, all I know is how bitter I've become. I dont even want to talk to other guys because I dont want to get my hopes up and get hurt. I honestly hate how bitter I'm becoming, and even worse is I hate how little I'm doing to stop it. Even when I spend time with friends it can be fun and fulfilling but when I'm home alone it all feels empty. I have a friend who just broke up with his girlfriend and now suddenly wants to hang out a ton, and I'm flattered but I keep getting these thoughts of ""I've been lonely like this for so long and you did nothing, why should I help you?"" It hurts me to think that and it hurts me to see how often I do it. 
   Before, I thought having sex would help my loneliness but then I lost my virginity to a guy on a dating app and I felt terrible about it. Several hookups with other guys later, I've realized that I probably just wanted to feel attractive. All the guys I've been with have been significantly older than me and I have started feeling like the older guys just want to exploit my youth and the guys my age are too good for me and that I'm not attractive enough for them 
       A year ago i used to weigh around 230 pounds (I'm 5'9 so pretty overweight, especially for a gay guy) and my mom would make comments about it. Last semester, I started adderall for my ADHD and one of the side effects is that it suppresses my appetite, so for the last year I've been using it to starve myself and skip meals so that I can lose weight and be more attractive. In the about 6 months since I started I've gotten down to 185 pounds, but even despite that, I dont feel attractive. I feel as though all I can see are the guys that reject me on Grindr and then i ignore the attraction from all the guys thatI dont find attractive. Hell, even the ones that I do find attractive dont make me feel better; I just feel like I managed to trick them into believing that I'm attractive. 
       I've been scraping by each day for the past month and a half and it's clear that this loneliness, now including a lack of a best friend, is affecting my life. I failed an exam for the first time ever (I'm a 4.0 gpa student with 1 B in my college career) and I feel like my life is drifting away from everything. I'm hoping that when I transfer I can become someone I more enjoy and start fresh. I wanna get a couple tattoos and a couple piercings, cut my hair and embrace a new side of me, but I'm scared that I'll just feel more alone. Honestly, I dont know if I can handle being more alone. I'm not even sure how I've survived this long, and I've noticed that I dont even let myself think of long term plans because I'm not sure if I'll make it to then.
       I've seen the effects of suicide (a close friend of mine passed away from it when I was in high school) and I wouldnt want to hurt anyone like that, especially not my mom (she told me directly how much a loss like that would hurt her and my siblings) but honestly I feel like I'm failing in life. Ive had tons more suicidal thoughts than I usually have, and i catch myself feeling like I wanna give up while I'm behind
      I'm still trying to push on. I'm hoping that something will change for the better and that maybe it'll he one huge thing tommorow, or next week, or maybe it'll be a bunch of little things. Either way its something better, and  I'm doing my best to hold out to see those things come true. I'm just scared at how hard it's been getting to keep moving forward and I'm not sure how I'm going to keep managing. If I fail my classes I wont transfer and I already have plans to move in June. 
      Im sorry for the long post, I needed to get that out of my system. I'll appreciate any insight or comments, but just being able to say this , even to anonymous strangers that might never see this, is helping.",moderate,2.391120737678307e-05
184,"I can’t be happy the same time as everyone else around me : It started off as a stupid theory. But over time believe it or not I have statistical data proving how insane the dynamic of my happiness compared to those around me is.

Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It’s uncanny.

The latest example would be the past year I’ve spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. 

October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I’ve been stripped of everything good in my life....

....and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It’s almost as though I’m the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It’s happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. 

It’s one thing never being happy. It’s another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I’m almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time. 

Assuming these aren’t thoughts of a madman and it’s factual, what would you do? Would you sacrifice your immediate happiness in order to watch everyone you love be happy? Or are you fine with watching your own people suffer while you enjoy life?

I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year’s prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot.

I'm 22 M and all my life I've been dealing with mental health issues
I had been through many different forms of ocd throughout my life also I wanted to write a post here since a long time ago but couldn't say anything because my mind is clogged with depressive thoughts
I had a pretty much troubled life since childhood and I've dealt with it 
But it got worse and worse 
I was planning to give up life 4 years ago but then I met a woman and yes it was love at first sight 
She became the light in my clouded life and for the first time I truly felt I'm here for a reason ""HER""
Life went on and I forgot depression even existed in my life but then something happened 
Her parents asked her to get married (stupid fucking conservative life) she refused 
And that's when it all kicked in again 
Her mother said I'm not good enough for her but she always defies her and she loves me
But my ocd makes me believe I'm a horrible fucking person and it's been 3 years since my battle and I'm messed up badly
I wanna know if I'm truly a bad person or is it just in my mind? The ocd thoughts about being unworthy of her and a cheater are thoughts or there's more to it?

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn’t enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I’ve gained about 40lbs and I’m tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me.

She'll never get to feel the warmth again and get a really dark tan like she always did. It destroys me that her death could have been possibly prevented if she had been treated sooner.

I should have realised she was so unwell in the weeks before her death, there were days when I would look at her and just think oh god you look so unwell, why did I not say something? She might still be here if she had got to the hospital earlier.

When she was awake but delirious I couldn't look at her without crying, she must've known something was wrong because she almost never saw me cry.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate.

The house was falling down with good vibes, positive feeling caressed past failures of what Christmas stood for any year before. It was going to be a merry Christmas for everyone, no doubt about it. Barr the one unsettled trembling in the shadow of its wake.

23rd, my brothers birthday; it was the only time I felt the fear of a real attempt. Any time previously was mere ideation or desire, the epitome of justified wallowing where i could alas drift off to sleep. I left a birthday card on my brothers bed while everyone was out; making errands, seeing friends, soaking up the immanent joys of the Christmas spirit. I was at home checking online the Hangmans knot. My wardrobe called to me sinisterly as it was just the two of us alone, it took the form of regrettable reminiscence that all these years before it stood there towering, i was oblivious to its fate. all at once so obvious but startling that thats where it will end. standing inside of it was as if it was made for me. It's size and stability; another dimension. In a way alike luxury, to go out like this. but all at once so painful that the odds were exact, it was clear more than ever i needed to get out ASAP. My dressing gown belt, soft like a teddy bear, mint green like a babies crib took on a form so ugly as it tightened itself around the wardrobes bar, securing itself so firmly, its dark potential indiscernible. As I let my weight go and blood filled up my head, it was the closest i've ever come to initiating death. As consciousness blurred and the grasp threatened control, there was indeed something putrid that the act embraced. Feelings of letting others down, as i cower and take the easy way out. The innocence of man so faraway and sweet. Who will deal with this and what kind of scar might it leave, forever taunting them unsubstantially with the horrors beneath. It wasn't right, and it wasn't the end. We take with us precisely what we leave with; The knots need to be undone first.

That night I drank wine, as i failed in feeling, thought and form. To go on as usual keeping undercover this malignant crime. 
All angles whispered deception as paranoia gurned from the cracks. I was falling away from reality and cowered under a mask. In silence and in fear, there was nothing left to say. I had killed the Christmas spirit but was around for the aftermath.  My mind looped furiously convincing the monster to die away. Such narcissism void of goodwill, urging to trade good tears for cold blood. Such a vile abomination, what a disgusting creature i've become; lurking above, friend to no one. The future had spoken and this is my fate, judgement day was here and now it's too late. Trapped in a coil, unable to liberate, the pressure was unbinding; as theres no way to turn back time.
The blackhole from where I lay reflected what I've become to this day, I woke up and prayed for night, just to hide away. Empty and alone, far away inside. Sucking soundly on destruction, damned off the face of the earth.
Life still existed, it's exuberant treasures and delight. It's infinite possibilities, its eternal flame alight. I see the potential the soul interplays. It's creative reciprocation between the parts; but in darkness and in solitude you forfeit the power to engage. This type of doom, you can't just walk out of. It's exceeds shame and guilt, with the regret and the pain it spreads. It is a malignant stain that can't be erased, the choice of sorrow against the light of day. The denial of the transitory and fighting against time. The refusal to give up the demons of the mind. The evidence was loud and clear, this karmic debt was in. I will have to work my life in defeat if I ever hope to make it back. 
There was no sound sleeping for anyone in the house; who tried their best to ignore. There is no point using words, it empowers the cause even more.

As days harshly passed, and cold winds pierced the heart. A raw and withered longing crept in once more.

262,"My mum died two days ago, my heart is hurting so bad : I feel like I will never stop crying and feeling teary. My heart feels so sad for my Mum who won't get to do the things she loved anymore. She'll never get to feel the warmth again and get a really dark tan like she always did. It destroys me that her death could have been possibly prevented if she had been treated sooner. She was only 54, she should still be here. 

I'm torturing myself thinking of all the stupid times that I didn't act the way I should have just because I was too depressed. Or the things I didn't do that she asked me too or hinted/suggested. I had the ability to make her happy and I didnt. I upset her just because of my negative mind and how effected she was by me. All the lost moments where I was in the room but my mind wasn't present in the slightest.

She was suffering for a long time with alcoholism and unfortunately cancer took over her body. I feel like more could have been done to stop her from dying, I feel like I should have done more and been more helpful with her physical and mental health. I should have realised she was so unwell in the weeks before her death, there were days when I would look at her and just think oh god you look so unwell, why did I not say something? She might still be here if she had got to the hospital earlier. 

My heart hurts thinking about whether she was scared or worried. Whether she knew she was dying or had accepted her fate. Whether she knew she was leaving us and how distraught we were. When she was awake but delirious I couldn't look at her without crying, she must've known something was wrong because she almost never saw me cry. It brings me some peace to know she can't think and can't hurt anymore, her mind is resting and she is free from the pain of life.

I honestly don't know how i'll get over this, I realise only now that she was such an important factor in my life, I depended on her and she depended on me. I should've been there for her.",moderate,1.620579481549284e-07

I moved to a new 6 months ago and still haven't made friends, besides my boyfriend. While battling lyme that gave me neurological problems and the worst anxiety and intense tiredness I have ever faced, I was asked to move out by my landlord. I wanted to give up, it took me months to find an affordable place to live and I was convinced I would have to move to my parents half way across the country. While I was in complete distress my boyfriend didnt want to be available to talk to me and needed to decompress. I was in complete turmoil and in the heat of my complete break down, I told him our relationship isn't working for me. I broke down with him, we talked about things and for the first time since we started dating 3 months ago he was vulnerable with me in a way that cleared up the struggles I had with understanding him. We said we would remain friends and I went home for the holidays. We haven't seen each other in almost 3 weeks and he avoided seeing me the one time he had a chance too saying he wanted to wait until after the new year. During that time, I have been crippling depressed. I have thought about suicide and cried most of the nights without sleep. Even tho I have found a place to live and my lyme has been under control, I struggle to make it by. I am the most alone I have been, I spent new year by myself and spent most of my time moving my stuff without an ounce of help. I want to reach out to him, since he was my emotional support system but I feel like I can't. It feels like he doesn't want to be around me, he just feels pity toward me and would have otherwise moved on. I've regretted this break up from the first day it happened.

Now we’re on better terms but separated and he’s paying for me to live in my own 3 bedroom house, for the sake of it feeling like another home for my stepkids. Totally love that it’s awesome.

Well today I could hardly get out of bed when he woke up at 5. Obviously that’s wayyyyy too early for anyone so I just put it off as being tired. But then I noticed a pattern. When he’s here, he wakes up early, we have way too much screen time in the morning because for three hours I physically cannot get out of bed (for anything for myself but I’ll grab him his breakfast/snacks/diaper and we will just be in bed). Then I just feel like I can’t do anything. Dishes?? No fucking way!! I haven’t done laundry in forever, and my house after three months still isn’t fully furnished.

I’m in college and have a 3 week break at home, and while it’s nice to have that break, I feel like shit in my hometown. It’s so depressing and just reminds me of how much I hated high school and how I had no friends. 
   Depression runs in my family, my Mom has it and my Dad is diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Not much of a surprise that I feel the same way (also they’re divorced). I’ve been feeling this way for about a year, since my second semester of senior year in high school. I don’t know how to explain it, like I’m definitely not bipolar but I seem to have a lot more ‘off’ days than I’d like. One thing, one moment just puts me off for the rest of the day. Being alone at school doesn’t help either, living in a single dorm and all. Like, I love having independence and doing my own thing but shit gets so depressing sometimes. School is the only thing I have to live for bc I get excited, I want to learn, being on campus gives me a sliver on hope for society. 
    I have 2 sisters (I’m the middle), and we’re all super close. I’m very close with my mom as well, and I’ve told them how I feel depressed (but I obviously can’t self-diagnose). My sisters support me through everything but I know they can’t fix my problems, just make life a little easier to live through. I’ve tried to have serious conversations about it with my Mom, but she just has so much on her plate everyday. My little sister was recently diagnosed with anxiety and started going to counseling again. We’ve seen symptoms when she was younger but it’s gotten worse. She’s attempted to hurt herself a couple of times and it breaks my heart. Since my older sister and I are at college and she’s home alone, I can only imagine what she’s going through. With that, I feel like my Mom doesn’t take me seriously. I’m always ‘overthinking it, being dramatic, or sensitive’. Usually one of her 3 responses to my ‘episodes’.

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate,4.252602527761393e-08

A little bit of context, I'm African and well in my culture noone believes depression is a real illness, to them you are just lazy or stupid (well not all Africans believe that) so their solution, you just have to get back up and work hard. I didn't know about depression or that I'm depressed, until I was in university and had access to the internet, but by then I was already sucked in deep into the black hole. I can't afford to go to a doctor and have an official diagnosis, but I know myself and I know I'm seriously depressed (if that is how it's said). Bottom line, I'm depressed, not 'kill myself depressed', but I have 'given up and I can't get out of bed depressed.' luckily for me, I have parents who care enough to look after me(I'm 29 by the way, female) even when I'm not working, we are not rich, but doing okay. My brother also has depression, his was so bad, well as bad as mine, but I knew how to hide and pretend, he didn't care anymore, so they took him to a doctor etc, they discovered he had depression(they don't believe it though) but the support us, so they were will to get him on the 3 month anti depressants course his doctor suggested, but my brother did not show any signs of improvement, so my parents decided to stop paying for the expensive medication and they believe that this depression has to do with his personality. So they gave up on him, he is 31 by the way, so he has never worked, got expelled from 1 university and my parents never gave up on him, but now they have completely given up on him. They just let him stay at home and his like a ghost, only gets out of his bedroom to eat, noone notices him anymore, my parents just make sure there is food in the house. I don't want to end up like that, so when I got an opportunity to teach English in China(I procrastinated on it a lot though) I took it last minute, thought I would change, get rich work from myself etc, I have a good business plan, which I formed and planned for this 1 month I was lucid enough to do it.

i don’t know what to do. i feel terrible, i feel like i’m slipping back to feeling the way i did before. i think him interacting with me the way he did made me feel like he wanted to try to be friends, i don’t know. i wish he had just left me alone if he had planned on leaving so abruptly.",moderate,0.015207456039775673

two days ago i texted with a guy i have known a lil over a year because he had been drunk the day before. we tried being a couple for the most of that year but it didnt work because of different reasons, mainly long distance going hand in hand with jealousy.

when he was drunk he texted me as he often did that he was still in love with me. i was overwhelmed when he talked about not being able to forget me. i was flattered but also i felt angry. i was and still am angry at myself for ruining our relationship when we still had a chance to make it work. i am angry for loving him at times and sometimes not feel anything. im angry for flirting with him when i shouldnt have but couldnt control myself.

the next day we texted and i thought that i had to end it. i told him i was in love with someone else and he should get over me. he asked if i flirted with him out of pity and i said yes. i hurt him badly and told him we shouldnt talk anymore. we said goodbye and that was it.

ive never stopped feeling guilty for every single thing i did to him. whether it was me making a dumb joke that hurt him, me breaking up with him over something that we could have solved so easily, being mad for whatever stupid reason or almost giving up hope when things seemed to get harder. i was and am an idiot.

i am incredible insecure. i hated myself and my body since middle school came around and i always think i dont deserve peoples love and affection. the last year was really difficult and there were times where i just wanted to end it all. often he was almost the only one keeping me going and making me want to wake up.

he is incredible. hes sweet, cares for me, knows when somethings wrong, respected it when i didnt want to talk and just so much more. of course he wasnt perfect. he too had flaws, like being very jealous, sometimes a lil bitchy or being insecure about me not loving him.

i hurt one of the most important people in my life. i thought i deserved it. of course our friendship and relationship werent always just flowers and rainbows. we had our fights and for a period it was quite toxic for both of us. but we both changed in that year, we grew with each other. we hated the year 2019 but kept each other going. 

but now i ruined it. i destroyed the base. i told lies to hurt him and make him get away from me. i didnt and still dont deserve him. ive never felt this horrible before. 

on new years eve i got very drunk just to drown out the thoughts about him and celebrated with my family, but as soon as i was alone again, i started crying. i looked at new pictures on instagram where he celebrated and just stared at him smiling and laughing. i cant deal with the choices i made. people told me i would hurt less and that i made a step in the right direction, but i just know i didnt. 

a right decision wouldnt hurt this much. i want to apologize but i just cant. there is nothing i can say that would make things good again. nothing would be as it was before. he wont forgive for something so horrible. i wish i had the courage to text him this but it wouldnt change a thing about what happened. 

it hasnt even been a day since the year started and i already reached rock bottom. im just pathetic.",moderate,2.804257049860175e-07

He replied with ""you can go snapchat *[insert my ex's name here]*"" in a serious tone and I started crying then got mad since I blatantly told him i was sad/depressed and in his head that response was the best fucking thing for him to add a ""lighthearted mood"" to the conversation. Then he acts like he's the victim because he was insanely insensitive.

338,"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family.

 I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. 

My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it.

 I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.

I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. 

My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. 

My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.

Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to.

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

356,"I’m stuck (18F) : It’s the first day of the new year and I don’t think I’ve felt more depressed in my life. I’m in college and have a 3 week break at home, and while it’s nice to have that break, I feel like shit in my hometown. It’s so depressing and just reminds me of how much I hated high school and how I had no friends. 
   Depression runs in my family, my Mom has it and my Dad is diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Not much of a surprise that I feel the same way (also they’re divorced). I’ve been feeling this way for about a year, since my second semester of senior year in high school. I don’t know how to explain it, like I’m definitely not bipolar but I seem to have a lot more ‘off’ days than I’d like. One thing, one moment just puts me off for the rest of the day. Being alone at school doesn’t help either, living in a single dorm and all. Like, I love having independence and doing my own thing but shit gets so depressing sometimes. School is the only thing I have to live for bc I get excited, I want to learn, being on campus gives me a sliver on hope for society. 
    I have 2 sisters (I’m the middle), and we’re all super close. I’m very close with my mom as well, and I’ve told them how I feel depressed (but I obviously can’t self-diagnose). My sisters support me through everything but I know they can’t fix my problems, just make life a little easier to live through. I’ve tried to have serious conversations about it with my Mom, but she just has so much on her plate everyday. My little sister was recently diagnosed with anxiety and started going to counseling again. We’ve seen symptoms when she was younger but it’s gotten worse. She’s attempted to hurt herself a couple of times and it breaks my heart. Since my older sister and I are at college and she’s home alone, I can only imagine what she’s going through. With that, I feel like my Mom doesn’t take me seriously. I’m always ‘overthinking it, being dramatic, or sensitive’. Usually one of her 3 responses to my ‘episodes’. 
     I want to seek help, idk if medication is the next step or what. Counseling sessions are booked at my school, idk how I’d be able to stay consistent with that while going to school. I just want someone to understand.",moderate,0.0003035360212542032

At the time we both agreed we would stay at her parents for a few weeks for a little extra help.

I understand but I also dont want to burden her family so I go home to our apartment and stay thinking she is going to be home in a week or so. Another month goes by and she does not want to come home. She says it for the convenience of being at her moms. So now I'm home alone and I miss my family. After a couple more months of arguing over her not being home our relationship has gotten weak and distant but we have a routine now and I am asked to watch my son while she works sundays.

361,"What the hell is wrong with me / I need help... :  
I just moved into my first apartment ""of my own"" at 33 (almost 35 years old) - granted it's ""section-8"" housing paid for largely if not mostly by the state specifically for people w/ disabilities - but that's beside the point...) ***ANYWAY***, I've got a big problem and I don't know how to get over it.
I should point out that I've probably posted here before in preparation for this move (it took 5 months between signing the lease and actually moving in and starting to live here - so bear with me if any of this sounds familiar.....if that bothers you, just please ignore it and move on rather than bothering me with ""trolling"".
Sorry, I got a bit off topic there for a minute. My problem is that I basically just sit in my apartment all day watching T.V. or playing games. I've met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when I first moved in (just to introduce myself and ""say hi"" - which took a LOT of courage for me as I've got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone.
At any rate, so far I've met (or at least casually said ""hi"" and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a ""handful"" of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program I'm signed up for or in the hallways. But I frankly can't find pretty much anyone I want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. There was one guy that I liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted (and that's coming from an ""uber-introvert"" LOL) or something like that - he didn't even want to offer up his name.
Having said that, here's my real problem (and likely the point where you all start to ""hate"" me lol/smh):
1. I'm admittedly somewhat ""bigoted"" if you will against PwD (""persons w/ disabilities"" for those unfamiliar with the acronym). A ""self-hating PwD"", if you will. It's NOT that I find anything inherently ""wrong"" or ""bad"" with PwD, so much as it is I'm so fucking god-damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing BUT a PwD, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another, because ""normal"" (for lack of a better, more ""P.C."" term) society doesn't want anything to do with us and ""God forbid"" they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us.
2. I will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually (***significantly***) ""below my level"" OR they have some sort of speech impediment (probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain's ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, I'm not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry) - neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it DOES severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. I quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who doesn't have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with ""kitties"" (true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats) or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. That's like ***WELL*** over 50% of the people I've come across so far. And the ones who aren't impaired in those ways that I've met so far, are either significantly older than me (this apartment's average age I'd say is well over 50+ and I'm not yet 34) or we just have nothing in common as I'm obsessed with sports and movies and T.V. and I have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. (NOTE: Sorry I should've tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but couldn't figure out a good way to do so).
Now, mind you - I know damn well that my inherent biases and SUPER anti-social tendencies are playing a (big?) part here, but I just can't bring myself to find anybody here who I want to get to know or hang out with. For that matter, none of the people I ***have*** introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say ""hi"" in passing me in the hallways.
I've thought about trying to find a way to ""get involved"" in the community *outside* of the building, but between my ""anti-social"" tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far, the other problem I have with it, is there is basically only about a 3-hour window - maximum - that I want to fill during the **daytime** hours (roughly 12-ish to 4:45-ish, my shows start at 5:00).....including transportation, which having to rely on ""para-transit"", means I could spend most of that time waiting).
And even that time I could probably spend catching up with shows I've missed that I want to see on demand. Basically, as has been the case for as long as I can remember, I'm a T.V. (and computer) ADDICT - and I'm largely okay with it, except I know it's unhealthy and antisocial. Ideally, I'd LIKE to be more social, but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly I don't seem to *want* to get to know (and they've certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we don't have much in common, and she's already admitted that I'm a ""dick"" - which I already knew so I wasn't offended, the idea is less than appetizing. (NOTE: thankfully, she doesn't seem to mind that I'm a dick, but again we only ate lunch together one time and I never got her apartment number and I haven't seen her since).
So to make a long story short - how do I get over my fears, and out of my funk, while still maintaining the things I enjoy (like surfing the net and binge-ing on T.V.) ? I'm thinking about volunteering, but the last time I tried (before I moved) I seem to remember those places always want you to volunteer - understandably, for a lot more hours than I'm willing to commit to.
I'll end by saying (if anyone is even stil reading this ""TL;DR"" post at this point,) that there is no need to point out any sort of ""self-sabotaging"" or ""excuse making"" on my point. I'm well aware I do ALL of that, and I just can't get past it....in which case I'm afraid I'm screwed until I'm able to do so.",moderate,0.0816948433614473

382,"i was recently diagnosed with depression : Hello, as my titled says, I was recently diagnosed with depression. I don’t know where else to tell my story but I feel like I need to do it to prevent myself from doing something bad. I’m 18, I live in France and i’ve started going to college in September. Since then, I was feeling really off, as if I was some kind of second character in other people’s lives, but also in my own. I was feeling really lonely, but seeing my other friends feeling the same way reassured me in this feeling. However, as the time went by, I saw those same people gradually becoming better while I wasn’t, and I started losing contact with them. I used to be really friendly, always laughing and going out, while being really dedicated to my studies. Since then, it’s just as if everything just started becoming black. I’ve lost interest in going out, making jokes and laughing didn’t light the same sparkle in me, studying made me feel dumb and empty. I constantly feel like i’ve chosen the wrong path, but feel like i’m not good enough for another one, and i always wanted to come back to my parents but i wasn’t feeling right in my place anywhere. It started to became more and more frequent, with thoughts of quitting everything, or that I didn’t belong anywhere, etc. I didn’t want to go out anymore, or when I did, I just needed to drink to feel in a right headspace, or else I just felt as if I was standing aside of my own body, not knowing how to act or what to say to make believe that I was doing okay when really I wasn’t. I started to see my college’s psychologist but he really didn’t help me and instead made me feel really weird about myself and the way I felt. I spoke about it to my mother, which wasn’t that concerned because I hadn’t told her yet that I was thinking a lot about death and suicide. She helped me find a psychologist, which I started to see every week, since february. She immediately told me that she thought I had depression and needed to take medicine, and so I had to go see a psychiatrist to get them. With my psychologist, we talk a lot about my life in the past and how I could see the world as another point of view, and she makes me think of a lot of things about me, but really she just points out a lot of things that i do or am that kind of make me sad about myself. What really scared me is that I usually enjoyed a lot going to concerts, which made me really happy and the last two i went to made me feel so much anxiety and discomfort that I had to go out before the end. I was really disappointed towards myself. By then, I tried going to several places to find a psychiatrist but no one helped me or took me seriously and I felt like I would never be helped, and I felt like I didn’t really want to on the inside. I wrote a suicide note, and I was ready to try to kill me. My boyfriend saw it and he prevented my mother, which came by me crying saying she didn’t know I had the intention to do it. We went to a hospital to seek medical help but there were a lot of kids who were really sick and I didn’t feel at the right place at all. We finally found a psychiatrist, which diagnosed me with depression, and anxiety. She gave me meds that I have to take daily and are supposed to make me feel happy again. I hate it because everytime I want to swallow the entire pack, whether it is to die or get better quicker. I started questioning myself if I had always been depressed. I’ve always felt as if I wasn’t part of this world in some way, or that I didn’t deserve to be here.
Now, i’m not better at all but I like writing down my feelings. I’m living normally and i’m trying to do stuff to keep me occupied but i’m always bored because I always want to do something but I never know what; I’m vainly angry at people that love me because they love me; when i cross a crosswalk I always think of a car hitting me and then of me suffering; I always want to sleep to forget that im alive; When I laugh I feel like I shouldn’t be doing it; I feel like i’m not really depressed because my problems aren’t important; I feel like i’m useless and that I’ll never be important to anyone; I feel like my life is pointless and that it’ll never change; I feel like I should always excuse myself because I’m not a good person; I feel like the ugliest person in the world; and sometimes I just burst into tears because it is just too much and the weight is too heavy and I want to take it off. 
That’s my story dealing with depression. Everyday I wake up knowing that one day I’ll take my life away, but I want to get better; because people get hurt because of me. I’m hurting them because I deeply hate myself and I’m constantly fighting against myself. 
I hope i’ll get better.",severe,1.6186120105570122e-08

He replied with ""you can go snapchat *[insert my ex's name here]*"" in a serious tone and I started crying then got mad since I blatantly told him i was sad/depressed and in his head that response was the best fucking thing for him to add a ""lighthearted mood"" to the conversation. Then he acts like he's the victim because he was insanely insensitive.

389,"Emotional Depression vs Chemical Depression &amp; how the mind reacts : Many of you probably know this but just in case...
If you have emotional depression, it's because something bad happened recently.  You lost your job and bills are piling up, your best friend died, you lost a child, whatever.  It's an emotional response to a life event.  Things suck right now, but they can and will get better because of time.  You aren't the first person to be in this situation, you won't be the last person. Hang in there, get what help you can.
If you have chemical depression, it's because your body isn't making the right amount of the right chemical, or it's going through the right chemical but too quickly, etc.  This is like having diabetes. It's not caused by an event, it's not a reaction to something which has happened or is likely to happen. It's a medical condition that you need medicine to control.  Yes, some people can achieve help with diet changes, some people can exercise their way out, but in all cases it's still a bio-chemical problem.
Talk therapy is not going to fix chemical depression.  Changing jobs is not going to fix chemical depression.  Having kids is not going to fix chemical depression.
Now, here's the kicker -- your brain is fucking stupid. It does not control the body, it justifies the body. If you eat a pizza and then later feel sick, your brain decides it was the pizza.  It may be that you have the flu and the pizza has nothing to do with it, but your brain is looking for cause and effect, so until it gets convinced otherwise, you hate pizza.
Another example:  You think you're drinking decaf, but your actually drinking an energy drink. You get the jitters.  You much be scared of something.  Something bad must be about to happen because otherwise why would you have the jitters.  OMG! You're psychic! You know something bad is about to happen!  Yeah, no. You're brain is stupid. That's all.
Well, the exact same thing is true with chemical depression.  Your bio-chemistry says ""you are depressed!"" so your brain says, ""Oh, it must be because.... um.... I hate my job! Or it's because I don't have a girlfriend! No, no, I know! My friends all hate me!""
So, when you're feeling down, ask yourself objectively: am I depressed because something is wrong, or am I depressed because my brain is stupid?
If you are feeling depressed and its made worse because there's no good reason for you to be depressed, you likely have chemical depression and should talk to a doctor about getting pills.  You can't talk therapy your way out of chemical depression.",not depression,0.08570428845090204

413,"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, 

For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 

1st jan 2020 

I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different after

Ive never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don’t know how I can achieve that at this point. I’ve contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can’t do this alone. Therapists are expensive. 

I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. 

The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. 

Girlfriend

I’ve been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don’t want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. 

Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don’t know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO’s come up. 

I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don’t know them. It’ll never work and it doesn’t, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they’re not happy with their lives and marriage. They’re miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO’s. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don’t want this.  

The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. 

I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don’t want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. 


My own apartment

I still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It’s too much sometimes. I can’t go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. 

I have been wanting to move out all year but that’s not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don’t know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I’d rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I’m in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. 

Band

Music is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn’t have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  

I’ve always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. 

This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I’m not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. 

Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it’s a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. 

They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don’t do these kinds of things. It’s this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. 

I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn’t cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this. 

They’ve never given me a proper reason why they’re so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn’t want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It’s a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade. I will get there one way or another.",moderate,1.0455002762037697e-07
414,"The person I consider my best friend is not reciprocal and that is about to destroy me : I am a genuinely introverted person, so it was extremely difficult for me to make this friend in 2019. It all started at the beginning of last year. We took some classes together, but I never spoke to him then. One day he arrived with a GOT shirt, I asked about it and we started texting since then and I found we shared a lot of things. I proposed him to study with me for the final exams of that semester, he accepted and that was how I got to know him much more (or at least I thought I knew him).

I was very happy to have a friend, after years without success. We kept communicating during vacations and the new semester began. Now we did everything together, lunch, study, we took the same classes. I spent almost all day with him. The only bad part, perhaps, was that while I always offered him my academic help,  he was not trying to do anything for me (not even asking how my day was). I let that happen because my happiness blinded me. One day he started to get away from me and did it progressively until we barely talked during classes and the conversation became very uncomfortable. I talked to him about the way I felt and he told me that he had started dating a girl, that she made him feel really blissful, so he asked me to please understand that. ""I will spend less time with you, maybe we don't have lunch together anymore, won't go to the movies together, but we'll still be friends."" I tried to understand him but I couldn't help feeling jealous, besides I felt now he was uncomfortable being with me. I decided to stop talking to him and I informed him that, which he took very well. At that moment my suicidal tendencies began. I did not understand why, I was happy without having friends before and now I felt so weak and helpless by a person I did not know the previous year. I guess my weak character makes me dependent on anyone who is 'nice' with me. My dog ​​died two weeks after that, she was the only one who had been helping me overcome all  that crap, my true friend from the beginning, someone whom I loved deeply. I tried to kill myself twice, I failed both. My 'friend' knew about my suicidal tendencies but did nothing to help me. However he was happy, why would he bother to understand my stupid problems?

On the last day of the last semester he decided to talk to me, he was a little drunk and asked if we could start from scratch. I agreed stupidly, which I am very sorry for. I agreed because I had no one else, moreover I had the clumsy idea that I could be happy again. Nothing further from reality. It does not answer most of my messages (messages that I write 2 or 3 times a week to not drive him crazy). He has not answered my greeting for the New Year and I still think he will need my help the following semester. I think ending that relationship would only destroy me. I have truly come to feel much steem for him and I still admire his extroversion. I'm already miserable enough, I don't want to ruin it again. What I can do?

418,"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:

I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. 

My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.
Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. 

The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.

I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",moderate,3.093939979351185e-08

And actually I was having a pretty good New Year’s. But it up at 11:30 the bar my friends chose to go to treated me like shit so I left and disgust. I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year’s prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot. Sitting there thinking that I had friends that gave a shit about me, when they really didn’t at all. I know it’s just a stupid tradition of the clock passing midnight, but I don’t know that I’ve ever felt so alone in my life, knowing that the people I choose to spend the night with, The people I consider to be very very good friends, my closest. We’re perfectly fine just living it up at a different bar and letting me sit alone. Eventually I worked up the nerve to finish one of the drinks I wanted to, and go over to find them. There was clearly no intention of leaving there anytime soon, they were perfectly comfy in a booth laughing away. After about 10 minutes of sitting there with absolutely zero interaction with any of them, they decided to go to a different bar. This one with the cover. I told them there was no way I would spend money at a place that I really don’t like, rather another place I really don’t like, I despise the first one we were at. I told my friend (my closest), I’d see him later. And walked home. Along the way I texted him that I don’t know if I’ve ever felt this much like killing myself, and that I didn’t wanna spend the rest of the shitty night and a place I hate and especially I didn’t want to spend money to do so. So far, no response even though I can see that he has read it. Fuck today fuck this holiday fuck the meaning we put behind it and fuck all the people I thought cared about me.

Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

Sorry for this rant, sorry if some things didn't make sense, but I had to take it out of me or I would've crossed a line.",severe,1.856718935972152e-08

438,"I never feel like I'm doing enough and I'm worried I'm going to be a failure. : I'm a 20 year old guy working about 25-35 hours a week for minimum wage in food services. I'm going to school full time and have a pretty solid gpa. My plan is to become a highschool teacher and I'm making decent progress towards it. This is about the only thing that I can tell myself for reassurance when I really start to feel down though. Still, it will take me 4 years (1 1/2 more) of community college to get the associates and the 90 units I need for subbing and an additional 3 years to become a teacher, and I feel like that makes me seem weak. Especially since you're supposed to get that associates degree in 2 years. 

Now to explain the insecurities I have, I guess ill start with my weight. I think being a fat kid really messes with your development. Not just because kids constantly tease you but it literally caused my hormones to go out of whack and give me high estrogen in highschool. I lost 100 pounds before my senior year and I'm still chubby 3 years down the road. 
I just cant stick to a exercise and diet regimen for very long. I'm about 30 pounds overweight with probably 20 of those pounds being fat. I do go running up hills and/or do bodyweight circuits and burn around 600 additional calories a day. Still I offset this by eating 2800 calories or more every day. With all that's going on in my life I wish I could just accept my current weight and say I'm healthy, but I'm not that attractive because of it. I have a lot of weight on my stomach and I have a bit of female breast tissue that makes me look feminine with my shirt off. My body makes me cringe when I look at it and I constantly am thinking about how gross I probably look. With all the other shit going on in my life I just cant set aside more than the 2 hours a day I already put into my body and the food addiction has actually improved from when I was a kid and would eat 4000 calories a day. I'm hungry 24/7 and it hurts when people tell me I just need to stop being lazy and get into shape upon bringing this up. 

As far as my face goes, I'm like an average 7/10 or so. I can't really complain about it even though I could look a lot nicer. I am told I look like a 16 year old a lot.

Another huge insecurity of mine is having a small penis. It's right under 5 inches with girth on the low end of average and I worry it will severely limit the girls that will be willing to have a relationship with me. I know everyone is different, I just hope that the girls I'm attracted to dont end up being the type to care so much. 

The combination of extra weight, female breast tissue, a bit of a baby face, and being 6'0 tall make me feel like an awkward teenager still and my body just wont grow out of it. 

As far as hobbies go I play guitar regularly and I do slowly achieve goals I set for it. Still, I dont have the time to put into it to become a professional level musician even though my theory knowledge is close to it. I used to be really good at piano but I stopped playing when my mom died. Music in general is the only reason I'm still alive as corny as that sounds. It's my favorite part of the human experience and one of the closest things we have to magic. Although guitar can do a good job distracting me, I dont feel fulfilled when practicing in my room. 

In highschool I was a heavy drug user for about 10 months of my life. I can't say for sure, but I theorize that I did a lot of damage to my mental development by taking xanax, opiates, and muscle relaxers damn near every day and often at the same time, washing them down with alcohol or codeine cough syrup. I was so depressed back then and my parents being old fashioned, didn't believe in depression. I self medicated and self-destructed for a while until something interesting happened. I asked the girl of my dreams out and she rejected me. My initial urge was to commit suicide but somehow rationality stepped in and I just threw away the drugs and set out to improve myself. I lost 70 pounds in 4 months and came back to my senior year completely different and clean except for marijuana. I think I wanted to prove her wrong about me because in my mind I was pretty sure she just thought i was a loser. 

Eventually i ended up experimenting with psychedelics which sadly gave me PTSD for about a year. I was believing in spiritual forces and extra sensory perceptive abilities because I was having flashbacks from the massive doses of LSD I had done. It took me a long time to figure out that it was my amygdala giving me flashbacks and that i wasnt seeing into some higher dimension and it really fucked me up to be borderline psychotic for all that time. 

At this point I've never been even slightly romantically involved with a girl even though many have been interested in me. I have strong requirements that any girl I date be a potential candidate for marriage even if she isnt necessarily the girl I end up marrying. Why would I date someone who I know my relationship wont work out with? One girl initially seemed great, but as we talked more, I realized her values were different from mine and that's the closest I've been to being in a relationship. Most girls, it only takes a few weeks of knowing them to rule them out. I find my situation to be additionally complicated by the fact that I like conservative minded women, but I'm not christian and not exactly conservative. I have bounced back and forth on the political spectrum until deciding the best result would be of compromise and unity, meeting in the middle. A decrease of radical ideas rather than a swing in either direction seems to be a philosophy that can be applied at multiple levels of life. 
A lot of college girls are crazy liberal and having tons of sex with different guys, not planning for the future, going to festivals etc... I wouldn't set myself up for failure with these types who are the opposite of the christian girls. 

I want to meet someone who is a good compliment to me, that would build me up and be a positive force in my life , but who also isnt trapped by dogma and institutional fears. I think I'm a very exceptional person. Which doesn't mean I'm great but that I fall under many exceptions both very good and very bad. This seems to make it harder to find people who i really connect with on a deep level even though superficially connecting with people is something I'm quite adept at, especially for an introvert. 

I write all of this out of loneliness and fear. I want to have someone to show affection to and to recieve affection from, and I'm worried that my inadequacies and my past and my odd perspective will ultimately lead me to becoming a failure who no one good wants to be around.

 I know I might be building a slippery slope here but this feeling gnaws at me constantly. Along with occasional paranoia and panic, and sometimes I just go completely numb. You see, I have really bad depression but I try not to let it define me and I dont like thinking that every word that comes out of my mouth is the result of a mental illness. So I've laid on the table so much of what bothers me on a daily basis and then decided to reveal that yes, I am depressed and I am also a human being who wants to feel like they are more than a diagnosis.",severe,6.796637973983323e-05

It ruins the mind of those it afflicts. Treatment is a long process, with so many wrong roads to go down. 

I have tried pills; many kinds. I have tried therapy many times. The depression I have is something I can't fix with these things, I have learnt this. It took over 10 years to figure it out but better late than never. And while there may be no true end to it, I've found the best way to get over feeling depressed (in my case) is to actively rebel against it. 

""I don't want to cook dinner, I'll just have toast.""   
""I can't go for a walk, it's too cold.""   
""I don't feel like doing anything."" etc etc... You know the drill I'm sure.

TL;DR at the bottom. 
My life just seems to be falling apart at the moment. I have a piece of (unfinished) coursework due in tomorrow that I've tried to do for several days, but every time I hit this weird stage of mental paralysis where I just end up there staring, not able to do anything for sometimes over an hour straight.
Normally in these situations the anxiety would take over and I'd just get it done, but this time it's different. I know it's important and that, by not doing it I'll just create more stress for myself down the line (exam season in May/June) since I'm essentially sacrificing 20% of my grade.  
This time though, I feel like the depression has finally won. It's decided that it's not going to happen and that's just that. I can't see the point in trying really anymore. Yet I'm still bricking it over handing in unfinished work. 
 Besides that, I tried to phone up my GP to get an appointment to talk about depression and get a diagnosis but as it turns out I'd moved practices to somewhere not near to where I currently live.

489,"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression,0.36268155916465383

There's really no one to share my feelings after my brother died. My parents workaholic and deeply religious(its a bit over). They really don't understand my feelings. I even told them that i am alone and depressed and thar i have no friends. My dad in the morning goes to work and evening to the prayer meetings and doesn't spend much time with the family. I do believe in God but I think my parents are over religious. My mom is also religious but she would often let me do what i want even it is something that my father doesn't like.

The issue is, most days I’m not anything. I wake up, and I go through the motions. I have a job, a partner and a preschooler son. Sometimes I I find my job and my family enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. I am rarely joyful, or excited, or particularly interested in anything other than my bed and the occasional television show. Before depression and my subsequent medication, I used to be a voracious reader. I don’t do that anymore. The words swim on the page and I can’t sustain my interest. I used to enjoy conversations with my friends too. Nowadays I don’t have the energy or mental wherewithal to sustain anything beyond basic small talk. I used to take an interest in politics and theoretical discussions but I don’t feel like I have the capacity to do so on any meaningful level now. 

I am occasionally overwhelmed by the pointlessness and cruelty of the world generally. This will strike at unexpected times - when I see the carcass of an animal at the roadside, or a beggar in the street. I wonder whether I will ever have a meaningful connection ever again, or whether I will ever feel anything beyond such numbness.

560,"I am struggling with every aspect of my life : Background: 27/F of south asian decent. I struggled a lot with my feeling in highschool. I has a estranged relationship with my parents. They had moved to Canada and has white collar jobs back home but here they felt frustrated and more often than not they would take it out on me. I worked on farms and helped ends meet. I quickly realized I wasn't quite like the other kids, falling for boys and doing the popular thing. I started to become very internalized and depressed. I even tried to kill myself a few times. But I was chicken shit and never did manage to succeed. My parents pressured me to do online classes skip a grade and be smart. I did most, but in grade 12 I was struggling a lot. I finished school with a great GPA, but I never finished my online class. I just had too much on my plate( my mental health was really bad here) anyways I decided to switch my major and take that class while I did the other intro classes at school. I told my parents, they decide I was horrible and I got yet another beating. I tried to keep it up. I was 17 and too scared to take a student loan so I got a night job and started working and school.during the day. With my mental health being the way it was and animosity at home I was struggling. My grades at school.staryed to drop, I started to get worse and worse. After two semester and realizing I wasnt going to succeeed I decided to quit school, I moved out and spent a month just sleeping. I was so mentally exhausted. I then looked for a job. I found a decent job working in a lab, I started to save as I eventually wanted to return to university. I went back to tutoring, since I was tutoring in highschool some of my networks were still around, so I approached them. Back in highschool I used to tutor at my parents home. The students asked if I was able to do that again. I approached my parents hesitant, offered to share part of my earning and tutor there. They said sure 50-50. Hey that was more money than I was making now so it would only help me save more. Time goes on, our relationship seems better, they tell me they miss me and I should move home. I am foolish because I believe them as I am moving home a year later. Enrolling in local college to do a bridge program and get into the program I want. I am lonely and have no friends and my parents are back to yelling and hating me. I look for friends more importantly I am looking for love. Highschool people made jokes about me being gay to me, I ignored them. Ofcourse they weren't wrong. But I wasn't the in crowd so I couldn't afford to be gay aswell. So here I am thinking I am on path to sorting my shit out at 19 and I meet this woman at the college. She seems really interested we hit it off, she tell me she loves me and I am puddy. I do everything she wants. Things at my home are tense so i find any and every excuse to stay out and with her. One day she needs financial help and I being an idiot let her have my savings with a promise she will return them within a semester and then she changes. She starts seeing exes and new people. She calls me names, she makes me feel gross about myself and I gain a bunch of weight. My doctor says my health is no good. I am hardly sleeping. I am prescribed xanax. I hate it so I just let myself cry for days and not leave my room. I started seeing a counselor at the college. Cut back to taking just one class so I can have health insurance and work for a year and half and save. Get a car. My.parents are fighting everything i do. Constantly calling me names, I am still being beat up. I start going to jiu jitsu. At 24, I get a handle on my head a bit. I have sat down and decide I am.taking a student loan and studying. I study hard and finishing the engineering bridge program. I have meet someonei think I like I am taking it slow.I had applied to school close but not in the same city so I could justify moving. I am 25 So I move to the island near my city and get admission to a good engineering school. I go to visit the person I have been seeing. I like her, I am open with her, she understands my past. She is sick though and getting better. She is living in south africa with her family. I only see her for 2 weeks. I return start university. I work my ass off and focus. I get an internship. I work hard, I struggle, I am sad every day. I am 26,My mother had gone through my bank stuff and found I has bought a vibrator. We fight, yells and tells me how much of disgrace I am. I have a ring I had bought for the woman I had been seeing. She is sick and can't move to canada so I want to marry her. That find sends me backwards. I had to tried to tell me parent a million times how I feel and the fact i gay, she keeps bringing up marriage to men. If she find a purchase so horrible how will she react to me marrying a woman. I tell my girlfriend how I am feeling, she tells me not to worry and do it at my pace and take my time. She tells me she is okay, she will wait as long as it takes. I see her again for 2 weeks, I love her and her family loves me. Seeing them makes me feel like I am so alone. I feel lonely most days but i am very aware now. 

I am sitting here today watching everyone post a recap of their decade showing their accomplishments and here is am.not even halfway through my degree, lonely and scared, uncomfortable in my skin. Unsure of how to come out how to find a balance between the guilt I feel for not being a good daughter or staying in hiding and forever losing the person I love if not today then someday.

I had the worst year of my life in 2019, spent almost 80% of the time in bed and got into debt and almost lost my job because of depression.

But in the past few weeks o have been working hard to get things back to normal, for the first time in 3 months, changed the sheets of my bed and washed all my clothes, cleaned up the kitchen and throw away 6 bags of garbage from the apartment.

Went back to work at 50% and will be working hard to speed it up and focus on either find a new job or get up to 100%.

I have to thank those who helped me and I am going to try to return the favor as much as I can!

566,"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

I don't know how to deal with my situation. Even though I get good grades and all, I have been seriously considering dropping school and work for a semester and just leaving, and just going where I want to go for a change. I want a new experience. I want to get away from all this shit.

Today, my mother says she's emotional - I ask her why, but I already know what its going to be about. About my grandparents and how much they miss me. A year ago I fell out with them, because I told my father about something that happened to me when I was young, four or five years old. 

My grandfather and I played a ""game"" once where we put our hands down each other's pants. We would also go skinny dipping in the pool a lot. I went through my early childhood thinking that this was normal behavior. I don't know if it's fucked me up psychologically or not but going into my teenage years it was always a passing thought and something that bothered me from time to time as I grew to understand that that shit was inappropriate.

My father is a bipolar alcoholic and he lost it. Threatening to kill my grandfather, etc. Drunk calling them and telling them he was coming over. It was a mess. He reacted like a child and there was no way to put him on a leash. 

Anyways, every month or so for the past year my mother would bring it up to me even though I don't want anything to do with it. She is devastated that her parents and I no longer have a relationship. Quite honestly I couldn't care less if I don't have a relationship with her father seeing as he put his hands down my pants when I was four years old. But she just doesn't understand. She cries and cries and tells me they love me and that they miss me and that this is just such a pain for her and them to go through. She asks me if I really believe he meant to hurt me. I feel horrible and sometimes I regret ever saying anything.

Maybe I'm the one in the wrong? I don't know. This is why I'm posting this, I need a second opinion. A lot of times I feel like a self-centered bastard because I can't just man up and pretend like nothing happened. But at the same time I will never be comfortable around my grandparents ever again.

Along with the usual symptoms (e.g low mood, emotional numbness, apathy, low energy, etc), I also experience the following:

**Inability to focus:** My attention span and mind in general constantly feels very scattered, making it hard to focus on something as simple as reading. Trying to focus is painful not only because it puts a cognitive strain on me, but I can also sometimes get headaches from it.

**Headaches/migraines:** Almost every day. They generally start either as a pain behind my eyes or a feeling of tension in the centre of my head or behind my forehead. The tension can last the entire day once it starts.

**Nausea:** It does't matter how full or empty my stomach is, I often feel nauseated. If I don't direct my attention away from the nausea and focus on the feeling the nausea will worsen and I'll start to wretch.

**Lack of appetite:** I think this one is very much linked with my increasing inability to enjoy things (including food). I rarely feel hungry, and when I do nothing really seems all that appealing.

**Fatigue &amp; grogginess:**  No matter how much sleep I get, I feel constantly drained.

**Pains:** I often get pains in the upper right quadrant of my abdomen, especially after eating. I've had an ultrasound scan of my abdomen done and nothing out of the ordinary was found.

**Feeling stupid in general.** I don't feel anywhere near as sharp as I felt before the depression. It takes a while for me to process things and I have difficulty remembering things. I tend to zone out quite a lot.

In case you guys are wondering, I've had multiple blood tests done for things like hyper/hypothyroidism and lymphoma. Nothing showed up to be out of the ordinary.

599,"Cringing over my own socializing attempts : A few weeks ago a friend invited me to her party. I was struggling to motivate myself and get out of bed but I had promised her I would come and eventually I got dressed.

I was not expecting much because she is the only person I really knew there and I am not very good with meeting new people. But surprisingly I was having fun and talked to a bunch of people and even started conversations (!!!). I guess the alcohol helped a bit... 

When I got home I was really proud of myself for going to the party and especially talking to people and not sitting in a corner quietly. The feeling of making progress gave me a little confidence boost.

Fast forward to now. When I think back I feel like I was putting on a mask so I look like I am a social and fun person. Thinking about those conversations really makes me cringe because now they feel so fake and pointless. Like I was just having them to have a smooth, non-awkward evening and staying in my ""party persona"". 

I get the same feeling when I think about times where I opened up to my 2 best friends about having mental problems. In those moments I really had the feeling that I am making progress and this will help me. And even though they listened to me now it just feels like being a burden and a cry-baby.

600,"How do you take care of someone with depression? : I have a friend that’s been diagnosed and she’s been really hard to deal with.  

She’s stubborn, sometimes she’s mean to me. I would worry about her all the time when she’s not with me and she’s having an episode because she would either run away from her house or cut. 

Sometimes when she’s not okay she’s mean to me. Not like “fuck you” mean but her way of just being sarcastic with all my genuine questions like “are you okay” or “im sorry If i said/did anythign wrong”. 

Often when she’s not okay when we’re face to face she doesn’t tell me what’s going on but I know something is wrong. Then she gets home and we’re texting. The second paragraph happens, then she starts saying how she doubts me and stuff like that. 

When she’s having really bad episodes during the night, I would pick her up from her house because again (she might cut or run away) and we would sleep in the car together. Sometimes when I take her back to her house, she would not go in, she would just sit in front of her house and I would have to literally beg her to go in. 

I have to deal with this every single day and everything I do is to make sure she’s okay and it’s REALLY taking a toll on my mental health. Its come to a point where I don’t even have a life anymore.

603,"Getting depressed over the new year : First of all I'd like to say I'm not diagnosed with depression, it's actually kinda rare I do get depressed. So maybe this is more of an upset feeling or something? Regardless, it's been getting to me. A few days ago making this post it was new years eve. I came home from Maryland to Pennsylvania for the holidays, and Christmas was nice. There was a small family party and I drank a little and made small talk and caught up with other people, then we all went our separate ways. Non of that bothered me. Then on new years eve, again I talked to the 2 other family members that showed up to my parents house along with me. We watched some tv, and it was nice again. But about an hour after everyone left and the house went dark I kinda just sat down and just started thinking. 10 years ago I was in 8th grade, was hanging out with after school, on christmas break, and was generally having a great time. Now I'm grown up, and dont really do much. I work, eat, do college work, play a little xbox or watch some tv, then sleep. Then repeat. Then I started thinking more how everything I used to have is gone. A lot of my friend moved and are gone, a lot of the shows I watched are off the air, places I went are gone, and places i used to go i cant anymore. Then it became clear how fast time went. It feels like yesterday I was on summer break, playing twisted metal on my ps1, my mom making chicken ramen in a pot, riding my bike up and down the street for hours, playing catch in the abandoned lot across the street, walking to my friends house to play gamecube, and standing out front of my house with my dad drinking a soda while him and his friends drank their beers. I started looking ahead after that. For my degree I'll be leaving country to work, most likely itll be around a 25 hours flight home then. So ill be leaving my home town further behind, so far to the point I cant make a week trip every now and then. More like a 2 week trip every year or 2 if I'm lucky. Not only leaving my town, also my childhood friends, family, house, places as well. My parents are getting older and people in my family are starting to die so I know that's coming. Its just.... wierd. I dont know if anyone else gets these feelings but this is a first for me. I wanted to go overseas to hopefully make a life there and have people from here come to visit and experience what it's like somewhere else, but it really really sucks knowing I'll be leaving my town behind. Even though it's a small town and theres honestly nothing to do and everything is really dated, its home, you know? My family's been in the area since the early 1900's and now here I am, feeling like I'm walking out on everyone. If anyone actually read this and made it to the end and has any advice or wants to talk, lemme know. My parents never had this problem, all my friends moved but not super far away, so they can always visit regularly, and my girlfriend has lived in like 7 different towns so she doesnt really understand the 23 years of attachment I have.

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

630,"Christmas Noose : Impending like a noose reliant upon the slightest pinch of gravity, Christmas came, descending the world and everything in it to the brink of the obsolete. I had just come home from being abroad for 16 months; a trip one would hope and expect to be tickled pink with engaging stories and comedy, wisdom and knowledge to be shared. but i was depleted, and the expectation of this hearty social spiel put me off ease. I had come to witness and suffer a lot about myself in the past months, a personal revelation of sorts.
and it's nothing new this sort of thing, but this time my self inflicting alienation was pushed to the brink of possibly no return.
Now factor in relationships of mixed dynamics, uncertain and weary groundings and my vulnerability to inevitable triggers, you have my worst major depression of my adult years.
Family burst through the doors as joy flooded the halls alike the day Christ walked the earth. All sin and past troubles forgiven, personal strife and habitual feuds overcome. Tensions in themselves silenced while penance was dealt and checked; for this one last Hurrah of the year, together we'll ring in the bells. The house was falling down with good vibes, positive feeling caressed past failures of what Christmas stood for any year before. It was going to be a merry Christmas for everyone, no doubt about it. Barr the one unsettled trembling in the shadow of its wake.

23rd, my brothers birthday; it was the only time I felt the fear of a real attempt. Any time previously was mere ideation or desire, the epitome of justified wallowing where i could alas drift off to sleep. I left a birthday card on my brothers bed while everyone was out; making errands, seeing friends, soaking up the immanent joys of the Christmas spirit. I was at home checking online the Hangmans knot. My wardrobe called to me sinisterly as it was just the two of us alone, it took the form of regrettable reminiscence that all these years before it stood there towering, i was oblivious to its fate. all at once so obvious but startling that thats where it will end. standing inside of it was as if it was made for me. It's size and stability; another dimension. In a way alike luxury, to go out like this. but all at once so painful that the odds were exact, it was clear more than ever i needed to get out ASAP. My dressing gown belt, soft like a teddy bear, mint green like a babies crib took on a form so ugly as it tightened itself around the wardrobes bar, securing itself so firmly, its dark potential indiscernible. As I let my weight go and blood filled up my head, it was the closest i've ever come to initiating death. As consciousness blurred and the grasp threatened control, there was indeed something putrid that the act embraced. Feelings of letting others down, as i cower and take the easy way out. The innocence of man so faraway and sweet. Who will deal with this and what kind of scar might it leave, forever taunting them unsubstantially with the horrors beneath. It wasn't right, and it wasn't the end. We take with us precisely what we leave with; The knots need to be undone first.

That night I drank wine, as i failed in feeling, thought and form. To go on as usual keeping undercover this malignant crime. 
All angles whispered deception as paranoia gurned from the cracks. I was falling away from reality and cowered under a mask. In silence and in fear, there was nothing left to say. I had killed the Christmas spirit but was around for the aftermath.  My mind looped furiously convincing the monster to die away. Such narcissism void of goodwill, urging to trade good tears for cold blood. Such a vile abomination, what a disgusting creature i've become; lurking above, friend to no one. The future had spoken and this is my fate, judgement day was here and now it's too late. Trapped in a coil, unable to liberate, the pressure was unbinding; as theres no way to turn back time.
The blackhole from where I lay reflected what I've become to this day, I woke up and prayed for night, just to hide away. Empty and alone, far away inside. Sucking soundly on destruction, damned off the face of the earth.
Life still existed, it's exuberant treasures and delight. It's infinite possibilities, its eternal flame alight. I see the potential the soul interplays. It's creative reciprocation between the parts; but in darkness and in solitude you forfeit the power to engage. This type of doom, you can't just walk out of. It's exceeds shame and guilt, with the regret and the pain it spreads. It is a malignant stain that can't be erased, the choice of sorrow against the light of day. The denial of the transitory and fighting against time. The refusal to give up the demons of the mind. The evidence was loud and clear, this karmic debt was in. I will have to work my life in defeat if I ever hope to make it back. 
There was no sound sleeping for anyone in the house; who tried their best to ignore. There is no point using words, it empowers the cause even more.

As days harshly passed, and cold winds pierced the heart. A raw and withered longing crept in once more. The Will to surrender to the hand up above, who provides tremendous shelter and pushes you forth.

634,"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right now

I've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. 

On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. 

but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.

It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ugh

641,"Forgetting past days with past selves when engulfed by depression and dark times.. Realizing this might just help me : Before depression takes full control and has my head filled with only negative and sad thoughts, there  is this stage in which you are free to be edgy, to be the emo and someone who has the energy to even analyze the oncoming depressing thoughts, to compare future and past, to get confused. But when the negative and numb thinking becomes the habit that we almost willingly turn it into, we simply let go of what we were and what made us who we are, before depression transcend in our lives. As if we welcome the new sadly comforting depressed life, and discard the old busy life. As for me, this is one of the most surprising yet chiling realizations  I've had when having the deep talk with the psychologists or friends. I could only react bewildered when people make you remember who you are. ""You got some of them dark jokes"" ""somthing you probably can help me with etc"".   
I guess the pros of socializing when depressed, is that it kicks you back into place.  
So when I'm depressed i will try to remember who i was, yesterday, a week or a month ago- Despite the self hatred and despair. In that way, it might just help me. I sound like a therapist talking to a depressed 13 yo, i know. But i sorta hope this is uplifting.

But now, I just feel dumb. No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.
My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.

Example
• I got into my dream school but withdrew because I got diagnosed with epilepsy the day before going. Every since I’ve been on multiple medications known to cause depression (currently on Klonopin and Briviact daily) Only a hand full of medications work for my type and they all cause depression.
• I got a car in 2018 and haven’t driven it because I keep having seizures right before I get cleared to drive again
• My SO and I opened a restaurant but he works all day everyday and I only see him at work where we constantly rub against each other. It seems he could live with or without me and either way he’d be fine. I feel so emotionally distant from him but our relationship feels like it comes 2nd to the business.
• I genuinely have no friends. Like absolutely nobody outside of my immediate family or SO. I cannot recall the last time I hung out with a friend. It’s got to be at least 4 or 5 years ago...
I just feel stagnant... my life feels like a blur. I’ve had anxiety since 6th grade. Everyday I get anxiety episodes (like a cold rush, an out or body euphoria, sinking feeling etc) and it’s become so normal to me, nobody knows...it happens. I just don’t say anything. Yet I have great things in my life, but this sadness feels like it’s covering my eyes to al of that. Right now I feel dead and worthless inside.

I hate myself and I keep on feeling angry by the fact that I cannot properly react or act upon the shedding place my home and my mind has become...

I even thought about killing myself the past days but I think I really cannot...

Being away now for two years also provided me with a feeling of not belonging anywhere (I also left home and my hometown at 18 until 32)...so I really feel I cannot belong, I feel bad, feel ugly, feel sad, feel alone.

655,"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

664,"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do.

I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even.

673,"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again.

677,"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

686,"A New year a new me (long) : I have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last New Years, but I didn’t, the reason is I had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver, you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning. While still being at my worst at this point I made changes to improve myself, I lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times I took weed edibles etc. I did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss. I know I didn’t push myself to my full potential, I messed days up, and I mean that’s fine but I got off track and into a depressive state after those days, every New Years I reevaluate my life, to be or not to be, and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether I want to approach the next year at all. This year I’m cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where I push myself harder than I ever have to see if I can do it and whether there’s something out there worth it for me. I am going to give myself the best fighting chance I can. 

It’s easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it, and don’t get me wrong It’s hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head. 
But...I personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad. If we don’t fight what’s the fucking point right?

I read a post I think on here where they named their depression frank... I mean it’s also known as monkey brain. This has helped me quite a bit over the past year But yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank, say hi frank you can piss off now. Or swiper no swiping lol (Dora depressed lol) but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank. From there I like to torture frank, franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night. The way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domain(you). flex your arm right now, it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control, remember that, if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will (https://youtu.be/--j5sGlrqMk) you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him, and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank, cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive, if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing, rejuvenated and alive( if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart, shits a god damn drug to me,it hypes me the fuck up.) torture methods also include exercise, have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chest/neck, hell no. 

I am personally going to challenge many things I have already been doing and some I have been slacking on and new challenges.
My list includes; 
4:30 am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of 7 am, 
No masturbation for the whole year, its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit. You will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time. Anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year. 
cold showers
exercise/train hard with a program( up to you) and only 2 days off for recovery at max. Get light body weight/cardio on these days. 
half hour+of meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed. 
2 day bulking fasting routine(snake diet)(side note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts, I’ve lost over 100lbs on it, just do it, it will make your life so much easier and better. It changes your mindset, if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline, what’s stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort, which leads me to this post and my new years resolution)
Beyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion, dry year.
learn guitar and master 12 songs at least(singing too). 
Improve the workload I can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects. 
Get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so I’m not stressing out.
Naturally these habits will replace filler activities/bad habits/depressive habits like gaming/Netflix/getting high/staying in bed from 5pm to bedtime stuck in your head, for hours on end. I have pretty much cut all of these out, I need to work on YouTube a little still, I have already cut down my subscriptions to people I actually watch and enjoy and that might only be 2 to 3 videos a day I watch. Maybe one for you is social media addiction, I don’t use social, get off that shit, that ding notification dopamine hit you get, oh who texted me etc. What did this person post, why am I not getting likes on this post etc. Also if you post god damn everything you do online, there is nothing to talk about with another person for example. Ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them. 

I know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that, but this is where I call home for the past few years, I just wanted to share my guidelines I will follow for the year to decide it all. I know I am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post, Or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way. I’m tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if I just outthink frank that everything will be better, you can’t outthink feelings. it’s time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better.

Ive been clean and sober for almost 4 months. This is my 3rd time in rehab and im getting out a week from today. 
I moved out of state for treatment and am staying where im currently at. I have no friends or family here. I feel so alone. My last attempts at getting sober always failed because of my depression and lonliness. 
The reason im so depressed and lonley is due to one large reason. I want a relationship with a woman more than anything. It drives me absolutely insane because i feel like im shit and no one would ever love me. I havent been in a relationship since the end of highschool and it makes me so sad.

The people around me say that what I do is good, but that just isn’t true. They’re just being nice and can’t see that the numbers just don’t add up. I cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when I took a bite I honestly felt like breaking down just a little. It was so god awful that I told them I refuse to eat it. I got up and walked away. Didn’t eat dinner that night. I just wanna feel good at something. Anything. The one thing I thought, I had some sort of skill. Some sort of worth, was in games. I grew up with it, played years worth. So why do I suck so damn badly?

I usually don’t let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can’t do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to.

There was emotional and verbal abuses, alcoholism and plenty of other grievances to fall back onto to blame for my mental health in life after. But through all that my mother was there, she supported me and cared for me when I couldn't or didn't know how, she would call me her rock because I kept her happy calm and stable.

But as time has gone on I've realized she was much more mine than I hers. I've struggled with depression since I was 6 years old and thoughts of suicide since 11, I'm 28 now and through all these years my mom has been there for me.

This last year I got my heart broken, lost pets, my job but she was always there for me throughout. Ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay, that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right.

I wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren, buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden. I wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but I failed that.

I took my time, telling myself there was plenty and I'd do it all some day.

My mom died three weeks ago. There was no hints or build up, she was healthy one day and then I woke up into a dream I couldn't fall asleep in. My family is small, group of friends even smaller. As the days passed I took note of how many left my sphere, close friends I was there for are nowhere to be found.

I lost religion a long time ago, I don't pray. But I prayed in that hospital, the hours waiting outside during surgery. I promised I'd be better, I promised I'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days. I cried and begged and pleaded.

And it all went unanswered. I felt like a fool, she would have never wanted me on my knees like that but I had to try and try I did.

Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It’s uncanny.

The latest example would be the past year I’ve spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. 

October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I’ve been stripped of everything good in my life....

....and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It’s almost as though I’m the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It’s happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. 

It’s one thing never being happy. It’s another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I’m almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time.

I never had it as severe as those around me and I'm typically able to function well enough to get by day by day. 2019 however has been really rough for me. At the beginning of the year my engagement broke off and subsequent events compounded on it.

I had started to bounce back by finding a creative outlet in writing and was so excited to make 2020 my year. Then my dad got sick. He's older and has had compilations but when I saw him on Christmas it was like he didn't even know I was there. He couldn't speak or walk on his own, I had saw him the week before and he was fully functional. It really threw me off.

Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same.

Pros
1. It has helped with the intrusive and existential thoughts. I don’t spend hours stuck in a loops of bad thoughts anymore. 
It has helped me fall to sleep quicker. 

Cons
1. My appetite was not the best before the medication but I was able to maintain weight. After taking it I have gained over 20 pounds in only almost 3 weeks. In 2017 I lost over 70 pounds in 3 month span from stomach issues (gastroparesis and IBS and stomach ulcers). I went from 205 to 135 dangerously fast almost needed a feeding tube. I used weed to cope with the nausea and appetite problems before this medication. It later was a factor in my depression sadly. 

2. Even though it helps me sleep, I wake up at 11 am after sleeping close to 12 hours exhausted. I still feel the sedating affects from the medication. 

3. Still hasn’t changed my dull emotions or lack of emotions. I still can’t genuinely laugh or smile (even while smoking weed). It just feels weird like I am in a haze. 

4. My short term memory has gotten way worse while Taking the medication. I always have had a minor short term memory problem when I started smoking (go figure). Now after not smoking for a whole month I was diagnosed with a inattentive attention disorder. I almost feel like I am not Perceiving time normally. Days months and years go by to fast and have been for the past 3 years or so (I’m only 19).  I can’t focus on anything and I stare off into space a lot. Which causes anxiety about my mind spiraling into the concept of time and how fast everything goes. I also have zero thoughts at all it’s weird like it’s hard for me to think of something. 

5. It hasn’t helped my anxiety at all. I still have social anxiety and fluctuations in heat rate which gets me more anxious because I have Bradycardia (35bpm for me normally). 

6. I can hardly work out on this medication. I have no energy and get burnt out easy. post workout I could almost fall asleep. 


I would like to know if anyone has had similar medication experiences? And does anything actually change? I don’t want to waste anymore of my life in a hole. I also don’t want to waste time with a doctor giving me a cocktail of medications to make me feel like a total zombie. I’m only 3 weeks on meds but I have spend the last 3 years digging myself a hole with abusing cannabis. I also don’t know wtf I want to do with my life. I am in fear of working for “the man” to make his pockets bigger while I am just skimming by, clutching on the 2 days of freedom every week. I rather be in the mountains in a cabin fishing and going skiing. Honestly my depression stems from having the 1st taste of what the majority of people’s “real world” is like.",moderate,0.00012107297476389052
771,"Meaningless.. : I really don’t wanna put extra negative thoughts in others heads but i just feel really down on the realisation that a human life is meaningless..

I mean, i used to believe in destiny, fate and all that stuff and to this day I still believe that the human mind is capable of more than we are lead to believe (harder to back it with action whilst living with mental illness). But so many things that are wrong with this world and so many things happening that just make me feel so insignificant..

What was that starved to death child in Africa’s destiny? What was that baby that died at births destiny? What was the 1345th person out of 5000 that commit suicide in the UK every years destiny?... 

I watched this video on Youtube the other day about 5 teens getting sentenced to jail for murder. They were throwing large stones off a bridge onto a motorway and one of them killed a father of 3 on his way home from work... And i seen a comment on it that said “Imagine living your whole life, having kids with your wife only to be killed on your way home from work by some stupid teens”.... And fuck that hit hard.. That guy is now dead. That guy that contributed more to society and probably more for his kids then I’ve done in my life and his existence was just wiped out. Some kids just doing stupid kid stuff and shot that man out of existence. Now what the fuck was his destiny??.. Where was the “everything falls into place at the right time” meaning in his fucking story....
It really makes me think on how nothing actually really fucking matters. We live in a much better society then the people 1000 years ago and can you imagine the suicide rate then? And how many of those people do you have the faintest clue about that existed..

We like to fill our heads with bullshit on how we are the centre of the Universe and all that shit but you really think god cares about the 1 of his infinite living creations.. We are the most intelligent species on our planet but our lives hold as much significance as that ant you accidentally stepped on on your way to work. Or that spider you killed because you didn’t like the way it looked. Or that flower you picked that eventually withered and died..

If there is any meaning to our very very very short time we spend being sentient. It is what we give it.. And I can’t see anything more meaningful than trying your best to embody good in this cruel world.. This world suffers so much and there’s nothing that should make you feel more proud of your existence than doing what is right.. You have to look out for yourself and your own well-being but give some of what you have spare to others..
This world needs kindness and compassion and generosity more than ever.. We as humans have the most tainted past. But strive to be the difference..

Give your spare change to that homeless man. Let someone infront of you in queue. Give up your seat for someone standing on public transport. Stand in protest against climate change, corrupt governments, unjustified wars, terrorism, poverty, homelessness, Etc.. All the little things create just that little bit extra kindness in the world.. 

All of you that are on this board know pain. Know suffering. Know what it is like to fester in negativity..
Don’t be a multiplier of this pain.. Be an example of the society that you wished you lived in.. You may not contribute as much as you want towards society. But you gave abit of whatever light you have left to someone else. And made there light just abit brighter. In that moment you were the god that gifted someone else. Wether that be stopping a kid from being bullied or sparing the life of that spider.. At that moment you were in charge of making a difference to someones life. And you gave them happiness. And that gives your life meaning...",moderate,0.8474848851959927

When she’s having really bad episodes during the night, I would pick her up from her house because again (she might cut or run away) and we would sleep in the car together.

This year has been probably my toughest ever. I've been trying to come to terms with the ending of a really special friendship between a couple and I, a whole group of friends due to lies being spread about me that included my best friend I made on the fetish scene and two friends died, one to suicide and one to a heart attack. I was made redundant from the first job I have had last longer than a year and a half since 2008 due to moving my role outside of London, I've had problems and uncertainty over my living situation and culminating in my Dad having a heart attack about two weeks before Christmas.

In the last six months, I've I purposely asked my therapist to start trying to help me come to terms with my own abuse, but unfortunately, my own mental health went down the more we spoke about it. This was around June time and around that time I met my now ex play partner. As I am on the fetish and BDSM scene, having a play partner is kind of like a FWB but you meet up, hang out, ""play"", have sex, whatever... Problem being, I pretty much fell for her the moment I saw her.

She is everything I want in a partner, funny, cute, curvy, into the same music (BIG BIG THING for me) and into the same kinks, even the ones I am ashamed of / scared of sharing with others. She always said she wasn't over her ex and didn't want anything serious but with her being exactly what I want in someone, I couldn't help but fall for her. She is literally only the second person ever in my life that when I met for the first time, my heart skipped a beat and I felt like my jaw dropped like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf.

She pulled away from me twice through kink guilt and then the final time happened in mid-Oct, I didn't realise how serious it was and how much it really was over for a few weeks afterwards when she told me she had feelings for someone else. This was the lynchpin that when it was pulled away, started my breakdown. I broke down to my housemate's girlfriend and sobbed my heart out so hard and for so long, my other housemates came to find out what had happened. I ended up in such a panicked state, I had to call the Samaritans for help. I ended up calling a few different helplines to try and get somewhere but it didn't amount to much.

I ended up going to the Accident and Emergency (ER to the US readers) because I was so low, I was worried I would do something stupid. They didn't do much but eventually, they referred me to the brief intervention team... which I only heard from after a series of shitty and frustrating events. I have spoken to doctors and spoken with a clinical psychologist now and they've referred me to a psychiatrist but STILL waiting on this too.

I still talk her occasionally but she's super short in her answers and it just hurts. I've only seen her once to give her belongings back, but any time she puts on update on the website we met through or her IG, I get anxious and upset, but I can't unfollow / delete / block because something in me isn't ready to let go. She's everything I want in someone I just can't bear to think that I could miss out on being with her. We'll end up running into each other at some events eventually but I know I will have to leave because it will hurt too much.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm lost, so lonely, I feel ugly, I'm overweight and no one wants to be with me and no one EVER wants to be with me how I want to be with them.

Since I broke up with my wife at the start of 2015, I have had about eight partnerships but none were anything serious, no matter how much I wanted them to be. It's been ten years since I have felt like I was getting what I needed from a relationship and I'm lonelier that I have ever been. I have some better tools to cope with the down times that I did before but I'm still hurting so so much and I just want a ray of sunshine, someone that makes my heart skip, someone to show me the love I want to give them, but no one I want to be with, wants me, they never have and I feel like they never will.

I was a really late bloomer in school and I didn't start having relationships till I was 15 plus and then didn't have consensual sex till I was 17 plus and the only reason I did end up dating people and such was because they were the first people to come along and show interest in me. I honestly ended up in relationships with people who were bad for me from the start for the pure reason that they showed interest and somewhere in my \*\*\*\*ing brain just went ""QUICK! DON'T TURN THEM DOWN! YOU'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE, NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE!""

I'm just so so tired, so lonely, so upset and so scared that I'll never be happy again. I don't want my Dad to die before he know I have someone who loves me and I love them. My parents are in their 70's now and they are starting to show real signs of aging and losing either of them could really be the end of me.

Sorry, this post has gone all over the place, just very tired (mentally) and just want someone there to hold me, to give me a kiss, gently stroke my back as they pass me while out with a group of friends, just anything to know that someone cares enough to touch me. I need contact with people, if I were to see friends 99% of the day for a week, but had to physical contact, I might as well have been alone, because I need it to fell like someone cares and right now, no matter how many screenshots I save from those that reply to my posts, no matter how many phone calls, whatsapp's or whatever, nothing can replace that contact, especially from someone that I want to be with and they want to be with me

Day to day thinking of suicide, feeling worthless and unlovable, etc. I fell deeper than when my mother died from cancer.

I’ve done everything to feel just a bit numb or happy at least for a few minutes or hours.

Recently I started getting better slowly, day by day. One day I hit the low again. I sat home and I was about to open a bottle of whisky and do some lines of coke then a random thought came through my mind:

Depression ends or pauses eventually. For 7 years I was not that depressed. If I keep doing drugs and alcohol and abuse my body I might ruin it by the time my life gets better.


What if your life suddenly takes a complete 180, you find the love of your life, you get kids, you get a great job and you don’t get to experience those things for long because when you hit a low point a few years back your body took a toll that can’t be repaired.

I did. Why? I’m a fool. I’m a fool who never learned to be a man. I saw Showgirls once (or eight) when I was fourteen recording it on vhs from my dad’s bootleg cable tv setup (yeah I’m 37, in self-loathing years I feel only a day shy of dead tired) and besides trying to watch it on mute with a boner that could cut diamonds I thought “hey wouldn’t it be cool to be the guy at the bar/club everyone knows and all the women think is a mysterious bad boy?”
This foolish way of thinking persisted as I focused on what I didn’t “have” in life. I thought it was empty, yet exciting, chapters of sexual conquest. Rebellion at the rigidity of following trends, living for wild nights and eating party drugs at dives and snorting coke off hookers and strippers. What I really was seeking was Validation: Someone in high school to acknowledge I was “accepted”, girls to look at me like, well to look at me at all. That Validation is bittersweet, you are never fully satisfied when you get it because you don’t feel worthy of being happy. 
You aren’t given self-worth you fight for it. 
Yeah, I started late but I did that. The rockstar shit with no musical talent. I lived in Atlanta most of my life until about two years ago in a single bedroom with no roommates for about three years. All I did was work enough odd jobs to pay rent and buy about a gram of blow every few weeks, some weed and two weeks worth of groceries. I lived for the weekend of going to my favorite bars and seeing the regulars and using “game” to see who I could pull that night.
Yeah that “game”. I was one of those lame guys looking up PUA techniques back when the pick up artist Mystery was a thing on VH1. In fact I got to deep in the dreaded toxic red-pill way of thinking for a while. That phase is long gone now. Men and women are fucking devious to each other until proven otherwise. I’ve embraced this.
Also while I’m at it, FUCK ROOSH V. Moving on.
A life of the bad boy lifestyle, for lack of a better term, turned on me three years ago. Ironically during sex with a beautiful but fragile Indonesian college chick I met at my best dive in the city. At one point in the middle of it we went from madly entwined, filthy, primal. Then I 🥜 and we are laying parallel in my bed naked on a balmy Sunday night. That moment right after cumming and all the dirty talk where your naked skin can’t hide your feelings she tried to have a real conversation with me:
“Why? This is a hookup. We agreed before she got here”
I switch on the charm and get her mind thinking about my dick rather than my personality, but I knew something had changed in me. Looking back now it was the beginning of me wanting more, someone in my corner. Not a lover, a trophy of how masculine I was, not a crazy sexy story, I wanted a partner in crime. A best friend that liked my genitals, someone who wanted to “understand me”.
I don’t have to go into details you already know. I hurt her, she really tried to get to know me and hang again but I blew her off. She was one of a few. I still carry that weight.
So being bored and restless in Atl I somehow convinced myself that Las Vegas Nevada was the place for a wild boy like me. In reality I should of stepped away from the partying and figured out why I had this restlessness and why the old shit was leaving me more hollow.
So I moved. To make a long story a little shorter, Karma has caught up to me. I’ve been here two years. Since I “rebelled” against proper advice and building any type of fallback skill or career I have no real career skill, just retail history and some warehouse years. I’ve only managed to gain part-time gigs and temp work.
My mom actually moved here to help and brought my pup too. My 8 year old German Shepard who I’m currently ignoring cause she doesn’t need to be around me in this shape. I’ve never physically abused her, but my antisocial mood sweeps are affecting her and my poor mother who is actually taken to Las Vegas much better than I. I’m dragging them both down with my moody bipolar bullshit and it’s getting worse and worse between us all.
Sex life is purposely in timeout. In two years I’ve met women as shady and distressed as me. Junkies chicks that offered me Meth just for letting them bum a cigarette, local Nevadan women so destroyed by dealing with gambling addicts and dudes who love the alcohol more than human decency, a few prostitutes (yeah I know, fucking kill me alright), broke strippers with gold hearts, and aborted attempts at having an affair with a woman that was engaged.
I feel like I definitely deserve this. I’m amazed I don’t have kids and a few stds. I’m a freak but a cautious one. 
Last year after Thanksgiving I went in my bathroom with a butcher knife. My dog barking at the front door at whoever. I’m in their with my phone, the knife at my wrist and about a half oz of weed (just in case I decide to not kill myself). The ONLY reason I didn’t do it was because I decided to call a suicide hotline for the first time ever.

“The fact that you called, shows that you don’t want to end it all. You just want someone to understand you”

I lived my life based on being the “bad boy” and look at me. No career, nicotine addiction, no family of my own, no partner in crime that likes my genitals to build a life with. I’m 37 and I’ve fucked up my whole life. $5 in my bank account, I’m avoiding calling friends now too. 10 lbs lighter and I’m just lying in bed like fuck it.

I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities.

01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know,

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Anyway I started new year/decade with the right move, didn't I?

Dont get me wrong. Im in a great place in life right now. I have an amazing boyfriend. My job is.... relatively great. I cant complain.

The thing is, though... my demons still haunt me. I have a not-so-great family. That is my biggest hill to climb and always has been. I hate getting like this because I get so irritable and snap at my boyfriend. Any little thing triggers me and turns me into this hateful person. Don’t get me wrong, I’m hurting. Im not a bad person but its easier to destroy relationships than build them, right? I think thats a common in this community. 

My other biggest vice is dependency. Right now the withdrawals from my medication are bringing me down, even though weed and nicotine help. Unfortunately, weed is hard to come by in my situation and the nicotine helps until I overdue it and feel terrible. Then when I run out of weed its like nothing is good and I hate everything. Maybe its just the dependency, and I know some of you may feel that drugs are terrible, but it helps. Because in this situation even a moment of relief is worth it, right? Sadly, I know sedation is only a temporary (and non-sustainable) solution. But it helps, right? 

I like smoking because it takes a whole cloud of thoughts, worries, and troubles to a minimum. It takes all the extra stuff away and at that point, its just me. 

I was the, hands down, happiest in my life when I was physically fit. I was serious about fitness and eating right at one time and thats something I want to get back from. But how do you make that step? I weigh the most I ever have, and also feel the worst. I know the solution, but actually doing it is so hard. Its so hard to focus on something when you are wearing a mask. Constantly focusing on keeping thoughts at bay is exhausting and all that I want to do is relax.

He showed me so much. Every young person needs a dad like him. It was so devastating when he died. The doctors kept telling me he was going to be alright. I was just a kid. I didn't know better. It blind sided me when he died. My mom slipped into a deep depression. A couple of years after that she walked out on me. I lived a long time alone before I reconnected with her. I can remember my friends getting birthday presents, being with family at Thanksgiving. It was an insane feeling getting used to just being alone. There were a few girlfriends but nothing serious. It's proven impossible to find a woman that will love me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last year of my mom's life I was dating what I thought was the love of my life. When my mom got sick and was hospitalized I needed someone to talk to. I called my girlfriend at the time but she wouldn't pick up her phone. Didn't respond to texts. It didn't take long to figure out she was cheating on me. It was a crazy situation. She was messing around with a married guy and the guy's wife spray panted my now exgirlfriend's car. Police were calling and there was a lot to deal with. Shortly after my mom died I received an audio file. Someone recorded my ex-girlfriend talking on the phone with someone about how she didn't want to deal with me and my mom's death. That she didn't have the time and better things to do. It was unbelievable how cold. I buried my mother alone. The time I should have been spending with my mom I was talking to the police until they figured out who was harassing my exgirlfriend. She destroyed the mourning time I should have had for my mother. This is something that I was carry with me for the rest of my life. 

This was a year and a half ago. I've been alone ever since. I've lost my sex drive and have nothing but contempt for dating. I've been in therapy but to be honest I don't think it working for me. I think this situation isn't what most therapists deal with. Someone that's been alone like I have and lost what I have probably isn't fixable. 

I got a text recently from my exgirlfriend. She was begging me to meet her somewhere so she could apologize. I blocked the new number she texted me from. I don't want to see or hear from her again. 

I have moments when I want to get out there and meet someone. I'll even go as far as to create a dating profile or go out where single people hang out. But when I look at women I just see this unreliable thing that's just going to hurt me. I'm just reminded of my failures in dating and how every girl that's been with me just wanted to find someone else with complete disregard to my feelings. It would be different if things just didn't work out. If I could get a ""Sorry but this isn't working for me"" speech. That you can't argue with. That you can get over. 

I've never felt this broken or sad. I feel like since she cheated on me while my mom was dying in the hospital then who can you trust? Now it's too late.

I’m overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I’m sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it’s being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn’t. I shouldn’t due to health issues and medications but it doesn’t stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I’m the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it’s either I isolate myself because I’m a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn’t ruin everything. I wish I didn’t fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I’m not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness?

I was (and still am) extremely depressed, but it came in waves. I am 17 now and have tried to kill myself 6 times and ended up in the hospital 4 times. My family has in no way supported me and constantly  tries to put me down. Everytime I try to have a serious conversation with them about what is going on they blow me off and yell at me for trying to get attention.

They make me move schools about every 5-6 months or so which makes it really hard to make friends. Currently they are home schooling me which means I sit at the kitchen table in full view of everyone looking at a computer all day for about 10 hours. I cannot go outside and all social activities are banned I guess you would say. Everything in my house is under lockdown. For Christ sake they have locks on the fridge and cabinets. I have to ask for everything and most times the answer isn't just a no, it turns into a whole ass lecture.

Going into this new year I cannot think of anything good that's going for me and I genuinely feel like trash. I got a really bad 'wave'  of pure helplessness and started to cut myself, I stopped myself before it got too bad but my arm is currently fucked up again.

 I dont know what I'm doing with my life and I sure don't know what I'm doing here. I guess I'm just hoping I'm not the only one going through this.

871,"Smart guy with a lot of dumb questions : I've really been struggling to post this, since I've always struggled to show any of my feelings towards everyone I know and even towards myself, but here we finally go.
I'm a 22 year-old medical student from Europe, 3.5 years into the studies, everything going well so far, passing all tests without even attending the lectures and starting to study few weeks prior to the test phase. Aside of that everything else has also always been going well for me, safe neighborhood, caring parents, good sportsman, nice friends.
But now it is that I just seem to have lost interest in everything I once loved over the past year or so. Maybe in life in general, since I don't see any sense in this life anymore. I know many people feel like this, but somehow they seem to find answers that keep them going. To me there is no answer to this question, that makes at least any sense. Some people want to be remembered, some want to achieve something for themselves, some don't want to think about these questions. I want absolutely nothing. Everything that I thought I wanted over the past few years only made me fun for a short time. Even when I have a good time going out with friends or so, that just vanishes, when I start to ask myself these questions and can't find an appropriate answer. 
So the best thing I've found to do since this started, is rapidly increase my weed consumption. I've been smoking for quite a few years, but it's gotten a little excessive the last year. I still mind to get my shit done, so I only start after I've finished what I had to do for the day. Then I roll a few fat ones and just try to make my  brain not think about those questions till I fall asleep. I've already thought about this causing all those problems in the first place, so I stopped smoking for 2.5 months last year and it didn't really affect my situation at all. I started again because I think it's just better to not think, than think of questions you can't find an answer to and that stop you from moving on.
That worked well for quite a time, but lately the quetions just keep getting more and more and I seem to find less and less answers. Why did I choose to study medicin in the first place? How could I think this would be fun for so long, even though it's just smashing facts in your brain, so that you can't possibly remember them?
But what hits me by far the most is this: Who the fuck am I even? I feel like what made me finish school without ever trying to ask these questions, is that my father would always have a talk with me when I got a C or worse. This didn't happen really often, but I remember feeling very bad after that for quite a time. I think that's why I still just keep going without even knowing why, I just couldn't stand disappointing him and my mother. So did I make this decision or was it the way society viewed me and I then thought I had to live up to? How can I go on without knowing this? How do I find the answers?
There's a lot more questions I struggle answering, but I don't wanna write too much, I doubt anyone's gonna make it until here anyway. If you read this and proved me wrong, thank you.",not depression,0.09985306125055808

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

882,"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

I was feeling fine most of the day, although around the afternoon I felt way out of it, like I was going to cry. I realized I hadn't had any kind of caffeine yet like I usually do, so when I got home around 4 I had a cup of coffee, and worked out (which I usually do in the morning). I felt OK for a couple of hours after but slowly started feeling crappy up to now (9 pm) I video chatted my friend and I could feel a sense of hopelessness coming on, to the point where I got off the call after only a few minutes and cried, partly because of how bad I was feeling, but also because I felt like a mess. 
I usually get sad at night, around 8, to the point where I don't want to do anything and just go to bed early, but this felt different. 
I'm on 20mgs of Lexapro, and 20mgs of Latuda. I'm also on Adderall Extended Release because I told my psych I felt like stimulants help my depressive symptoms go away, as well as help my concentration, which they seem like they both do.
My main problem is that I feel like my depression is getting worse, but also that I get depressed at night and don't want to play video games or anything like I used to, and really just want to sleep. Maybe it's my Adderall wearing off (I take it around 8 or 9 am) Maybe it's my environment (I've tried to switch up the furniture in my room to basically no effect) Maybe I'm just bored and overthinking it?

I work 12+ hour days between work and school, and since I'm a freshman, I don't even see any reward for my effort except getting 1/400 closer to the cost of my degree every week (if I'm lucky.) Even my personal taste is becoming ""old people."" According to posts from r/starterpacks and elsewhere, things I like such as indie music, craft beer and tattoos are apparently ""insufferable pretentious yuppie boomer millennial shit"" now.

Never been one to be invited to parties as much as I socialize and try to make more friends. but a friend invited me to one last minute tonight.

938,"I really. Really need help. I feel like my life is over. I have no one. I lost everything. : Hi there. This post will be fairly short because i prefer talking about my problems in dms. But uhh. Ill just say whats happening.

IVE been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a year and a half.

She saved me from an abusive relationship. And she Was the best thing in my life. But she was a very broken and unstable person.

She.. Lied. About being raped.  She made fake accounts to harass herself. She made fake accounts to accuse me and herself of cheating on eachother. She has anger issues. And an abusive family.

I helped her as much as i could. And she did too. I saved her from her abusive family and helped make her life better.

Weve been having relationship problems because after she confessed to her lies. She became increasingly abusive and harsh.  And.. A few days ago she cheated. On me.  It was on the same day that she insulted me and called me worthless and stuff

I dont know what to do.. I really dont. I fucking love her so much. I love her more than any thing and.. I forgave everything. My past girlfriend cheated on me 3 times and boasted about it and rubbed it in my face. I let my current know this. I let her know that any thing is okay. But cheating is the one thing i can not deal with. And now when it happened ive been so.. Broken.

I dont think she hates me. She has anger issues. She suffers from bullying. Abusive parenting. And lots of sexual assault.
Shes fucked up. Shes the most innocent. Pure person. But also the most sexual and slutty person. I dont know what to do.. Ive been crying so Much and i have no one to talk to. My best friend thats been the only person supporting kind of.. Got tired of me and told me to fuck off. I feel so suicidal and broken. I cant really talk to anyone in reallife due to my country.

I havent mentioned many things. So please dont make an opinion of me or her before asking me things. If youre willing to help me send me a message and  ill respond as fast as i can

Also somethjng important to mention is that we have really. Really good synergy. Physically we  are perfect for eachother. Sexually too. And our humor. Music taste. Beliefs. Religion. Everything is ideal.",moderate,2.0218365286260984e-07

949,"One of my best friends committed suicide a few months back. Starting to think he had the right idea. : So about a month ago I found out that one of my oldest and dearest friends died way back in August. It took weeks after learning about his death from his family (from whom he was estranged, and who in turn waited months to tell any of his friends that he had died in the first place) to finally find out that it was indeed suicide, which many of us suspected was the cause. We all knew each other from working at summer camp together, indeed this guy was my counselor and mentor before he was a friend and an equal, and we all live all over the place so we often go months without seeing or talking with each other. Hence why none of us found out for months.

But that’s not exactly what I want to talk about here. I’ve been struggling with depression, often manageable but at times quite debilitating, for basically my whole life, certainly my whole “adult” life, and really since at least age 11 or so (for the record, I’m 26 now). I’m so incredibly fortunate to have family and social circles (small, but there) who are at least sympathetic and to have had access to therapy and medication for many years. And while it’s hard to say I’ve ever thrived living with depression, I have had some successes in my life: I finished high school and university with good grades, I’ve made some really great friends, I’ve done some writing which I’m actually halfway proud of, I’ve had one really great romantic relationship for two years - and when that relationship ended a little over a year ago, it ended on good terms and my ex and I are still friends. And, least or perhaps most of all, I’m still alive. I’m still here. 

But this last point at least is starting to feel less like an achievement and more like a weakness.

I’ve never believed suicide was “the cowards way out,” nor have I ever understood why people often react with anger towards a loved one who commits suicide. Or maybe I should say, I understand, but I don’t sympathize with that point of view. My sympathy has only ever laid with those who kill themselves, and when I found out about my friend this was my reaction as well; now that the shock has worn off, I feel nothing but sympathy, and a hope that his pain is truly over now.

I’ve also for a long time now held some fairly dark and fatalistic views about life in general, which I realize is almost certainly heightened if not directly the result of my depression, but my thoughts about this still resonate. That we are all doomed to die, and anything we experience in terms of achievements and happiness are fleeting, that in the end we will all be forgotten by the nothingness of infinite time. And further, that even the easiest and happiest life is filled with suffering. Maybe even that life itself is a bad thing, defined by suffering and sustained by an impossible desire to make it last as long as possible.

Yes, I know. I know how doom and gloom this all sounds, that it very clearly emanates from depression and sounds a bit like an angsty teenager’s pseudo-philosophical diary scribbles. And it’s also worth noting that this year, the last couple of years really, has been really pretty rough. I can’t hold down a job, my girlfriend and I broke up, I moved back in with my parents, and I can see all of my old friendships slowly withering. God, how much I want to have a beer with a friend and have it not feel like I’m being done a favor out of pity. God, how I want to have my hand held in an intimate gesture, I miss it all so much. 

And of course, all of this is hitting me particularly hard on New Year’s Day. Doubt that’s a coincidence. 

Not really asking for specific advice, to be honest just writing this has made me feel a bit better. I’m also going to post this on /r/suicidewatch, though even after just writing this I don’t feel in any imminent danger right now. Thanks for reading",moderate,0.00034032988098287254

Im an eighteen year old who struggles with a circuit board of mental issues. 
life is so confusing and anxiety inducing
When i was little, i wanted to grow up to be an animator, i loved watching shows and drawing, i found most of my creative output came in drawing. 


Last week, my portfolio was rejected. 
I had spent months, almost a year on my portfolio. Drawing, scrapping, crying, tearing, repeat. 
I had taken a few months to gather money for college, and i havent had the heart to tell my mom i didnt get in. 
I havent told my mom things in a long time, and i lie to her about my mental health. The amount of times ive held a knife and contemplated just slitting my throat open or holding all my night medication and downing it in one go before going to sleep shocks me sometimes. 
Its almost a daily thing, an hourly thing. With every action i do i think of a way to off myself on the spot. 

And the only thing keeping me from doing it is the time i told my dad i was having suicidal thoughts, and he broke down crying saying he is afraid to come home one day from work to find his youngest daughter dead. 
And that he couldve been home to prevent it.

And when in 2013, when my cousins died in a plane crash, my mom was devastated, she wouldnt stop crying, my dad had to restrain her, and i just started crying because i was so confused. Those are her niece and nephew but what about her Daughter? 
I may not get along with my mom, but i still love her too much to put her through that pain.

01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know,

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Anyway I started new year/decade with the right move, didn't I?

With the new year of 2020 here, I honestly feel that I should be something more than I was excluding wisdom gained from aging. Growing up I was a huge gamer and I love games always have. I’ve also loved going into different skills and hobbies including cooking, drawing, instruments, and others. Then comes 2019, I just lose my ability to do everything. The people around me say that what I do is good, but that just isn’t true. They’re just being nice and can’t see that the numbers just don’t add up. I cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when I took a bite I honestly felt like breaking down just a little. It was so god awful that I told them I refuse to eat it. I got up and walked away. Didn’t eat dinner that night. I just wanna feel good at something. Anything. The one thing I thought, I had some sort of skill. Some sort of worth, was in games. I grew up with it, played years worth. So why do I suck so damn badly? Moba’s I just seem to never be able to do the right thing at the right time, constantly being flamed. FPS’s people constantly ask if I’m intentionally deranking. MMO’s I can’t even do the end game content because I just don’t have the items to do it, and I refuse to pay to win. I usually don’t let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can’t do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to. I lost practically everyone I used to know, and they moved on. Everyone does eventually. I don’t know if I’m depressed but, I feel like my worth is zero to none at this point.

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

I have trouble maintaining relationships, leaving the house, and have not been able to hold a job more than 3 months in quite some time. I do have a loving, supportive partner. These past few months have been significantly worse. I have had suicidal thoughts, have been self harming with greater intensity, and need help with basic tasks because I have no energy/motivation despite sleeping all day. I have pretty intense panic attacks.

What if they say they can't help me? Or, I saw a crime documentary on a crazy therapist who blackmailed her patients to commit crimes. What if my therapist is crazy?

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn’t leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I’m married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I’m a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can’t go out and do social things. It’s not because I’m anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I’m not enjoying all the things I love.

It's very often that I see people here discussing their experience with therapy, psychiatry and mental healthcare. All of these vary according to every person, and in the case of the last aspect, every country. 
I'm a Spanish teenager and was interned after almost committing suicide in February 2019. A year ago now. I was put into a ward meant for adolescents (15-17), specifically. I live in a region with a population of nearly 5.000.000, whose total capacity for at-risk teens is... 5 rooms. Individual ones. Only 5 teens can receive attention. You will hardly ever see someone leave in less than 2 weeks, and you'll almost never see someone spend more than 4. It's just a quick fix. A patch. Momentary safety.
For all you who have gone through internment, what was your experience like?

I arrive, thank the host, bla bla. First hour or two im just chilling with the guy who was gonna leave. I get a beer, and drink most of it (my friend left after) and socially im doing better than i thought i would. Im having ""fun"". Few shots later still having fun. I had seemed to have hit it off with a girl who was single (spoiler shes the one night). Midnight comes and i drink like 3-4 glasses of champagne. I lie down --&gt; im drunk. 

After i get drunk i get loudish/talkative and just generally say whatever comes to my mind, including secrets/insecurities/depression. So my friend and the girl babysit me cause i cant walk in a straight line. And i start ranting on and on about my problems (mom's cancer, depression, choking myself, etc.). I think i cuddled the girl, but she stopped cause she wanted me to be sober while doing stuff. After that she took me on a walk so i could get fresh air. After which i started to hug her (vigorously) in front of my friend. 

Since this was also a sleepover me and her slept in the guest room. By this time i was kinda sober. I started to cuddle her which lead to making out and groping, but she stopped from going further cause again i was still kinda drunk and she just met me. The rest of the night we just cuddled. 

After we woke up she went to her friends. I was sober by this point which meant i went from confident social guy to depressed anti social guy. 
We talked a bit about why i was being antisocial, cuddled a bit more, i got her number and hugged for a really long time before i left.

After which i felt like shit not from the booze but just from the emptiness. I want to meet her again, but im scared that she'll get bored of the real me, the antisocial depressed me. She knew the drunk me, not the real one. Im also scared i'll hurt her physically or verbally, due to my depression and my previous relationship where i hurt the other person by ignoring her asking me out for over a year, even though she knew i knew.

Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.

The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?

Managed to find £11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That £11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. 

I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. 

It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.

Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother?

1048,"Struggling : Hey everyone.

It's the New Year, and like a lot of people around here I'm really struggling. If everything goes well, I'll have 3 years sober. I guess without the alcohol and the drugs I'm just left with myself, and that is the problem.

Without the drugs and alcohol I just cannot seem to make the slightest effort to make meaningful relationships with people. I still go to meetings but even in a room full of people I can feel so alone. I don't have friends, no relationships the past few years, and now I guess I've isolated myself so much that I just don't know how to talk to people. I drive them away, and eventually, the contact will stop altogether. I don't know how I'll go through this year. I just hope I can make it to the three years in March. 

Thanks for reading. I don't expect people to really care, but I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

I hope everyone else has a better New Year than I did.",moderate,0.8952233318265702

And I'm so incredibly terrified and utterly hopeless about it.
All my friends are happy about this and I can't just break down like this to ruin the mood.

I'm going to lose so many friends this decade.
I don't even know how to fucking function as an adult. I will remanisce on the memories of me being a kid right now in the future and break down in bed, wishing I could go back in time.
But I can't.
And I can't stop it.

I'm going to miss and wish and beg to come back here, despite the hell I'm living in right now I will want to go back to the nostalgic simplier times and now they're going to go away forever.

I'm never going to have this again.
My family will die.
My friends will go.
People I love will disappear.
And I'm crying now. I am so incredibly deeply shaken inside. I am so petrified and terrified of time itself.
I just want to go back. I want to go back and feel *fucking happy again.*

Time is running out.
And as I hear fireworks outside my room right now I'm desperately clinging to these lasting minutes.

Graduated teacher's college. Bought a 2019 car. Has a career. Bought a house. I know many people who are married or have careers, and I know many people who have no careers or aren't married and are back at school.

I lost 2 jobs in 2019. I have no partner. I have no career. I have no path in life. I have accomplished nothing, amounted to nothing. I have a university degree that's beyond useless and a stupid graduate diploma from college. I hate my industry. I still live in a condo my parents own. I have a car I got when my grandma died (I much rather have her back.) Everything I have I did not work for.

I don’t respond to CBT. I’ve tried it multiple times over the years and my therapist said it’s time to stop. I’m too mentally and physically ill for regular treatments and have to experiment.
