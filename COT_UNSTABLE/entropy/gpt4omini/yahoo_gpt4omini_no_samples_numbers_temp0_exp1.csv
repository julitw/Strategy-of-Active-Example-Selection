It is only one component of the entire equation.  Equally important is your form, the number of reps and sets you do, how long your workout is, how much rest you take in between sets, the speed of both the concentric component and the eccentric component, and others as well.  The push/pull method just happens to be one of the more popular ways of lifting.\n\n\nOne advantage of this method is that you are exercising muscles that wrok together in one session.  For example, usually the pecs and the triceps are worked in the same sessions.  The triceps work as a synergist during most pec movements (meaning they help the pecs to complete the movement).  So that if you do your chest workout first, then you do have to work your triceps as hard because they have been pre-exhaust by the chest workout.\n\nOn the other hand, by seperating synergistic muscle groups, for example doing triceps and chest on seperate days, then the triceps will get worked twice as many times during the week -- once during the workout specifically aimed at the triceps, and once as a synergist during the chest workout.\n\nFor more information on all off this, see the link below.  It's probably the best written book on weightlifting and exercise on the market today.",Health,0.07401633923111514

56,"Title: I am a American woman in love with Indian man. What is the easiest way to get him to America?, Content: , Answer: First question to you is, have you met this man in person and spent a significant amount of time with him in person?  and I mean face to face, not over the phone or webcams, etc.  If not, you want to do this first, and you might want to first visit his country if you have not done so, then next, bring him over on a tourist visa to visit you.  Internet relationships can be a great start, but the real proof is face to face, day to day.\n\nAlso, because these are very different cultures, do a lot of research on the Indian culture, so that you are well-informed.  Love does not conquer all, you need to be ready to deal with the obstacles and difficulties, and knowing what they might be will be most helpful to you.\n\nMake sure that he is not just wanting to find a way to the U.S.  A lot of Indians want to move to Canada or the U.S., and some will use marriage if they have to, to accomplish this.  You would rather be aware of this now, than later.\n\nWhen you are ready to bring him over permanently, if that is your decision, then you will want to go to the Immigration website and read through the material and fill out the application forms to go through the process.  If you need or want help, consult an immigration lawyer, preferably one with a good reputation.\n\nHere are links for you:\n\nVisa Home Page\nhttp://www.travel.state.gov/visa/visa_1750.html\n\nImmigration Home Page\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/graphics/",Politics & Government,5.6119374695750355e-05

77,"Title: Why do some people have more love in their heart than others?, Content: , Answer: To give love you have to know how to replenish it within yourself so there is always something to give away. If you practice a religious faith, many of the teachings are about a loving God who is the source of all love. Rules aside, most religious people feel like, since they are loved by God, and since so is everyone else, they should love others too, and they find it somewhat easier to do. Most folks who believe in God consider it, among other things, to be an endless well of goodness to draw from.\n\nAlso a good healthy dose of self-esteem. If you don't love yourself, you can't truly love someone else. And if you don't treat yourself well, who else will? People who have a lot of love in their hearts also show love to themselves.\n\nOf course, it has to do with how you were raised and if anything happened to punish you for loving others or if you lost trust or got hurt really bad in the process of giving love to others. It can harden you. \n\nBut don't confuse affection or endearments with love. There are lots of ways a person can love another and they aren't always easy or pleasant. Love is hard work sometimes, not always being nice. So if you think a person doesn't have love in their heart, they probably do, they probably show it in different ways, or it is hidden.",Business & Finance,6.68293180488779e-05

A neutral foot lands on the outside corner of your heel, roles inwards so that it is flat and then roles out on the angle of your toes at toe off. An overpronated foot lands on the outside of the heel, roles in flat but continues to roll in and comes off even with or inside the big toe side of the shoe. The reason this is a problem is that the muscle that is supposed to role you out at toe off (tibialis anterior muscle) is not strong enough to counter the weight of your body that has rolled your foot inwards too far. It continues to pull until it actually pulls itself off the bone where it attaches (this is what shinsplints are - shin splints are not a muscle fibre strain you are actually tearing muscle from the bone which is why it hurts so much and takes so long to heal). The reason why you didn't feel it before is because under less load (walking = less downward force and elliptical = no downward force) your body wasn't thrown into am overpronated position. Now that your are running the repetition of the overpronated state is resulting in shin splints. \nTo get rid of the shin splints you must first rest the muscle, ice wil help with the inflamation and pain. Next you need to get a really good pair of shoes designed to work with YOUR body. Just going and spending a lot of money will not gaurantee a good pair for you. It would be like buying a Ferarri for off roading - it's a great car but not for what you need. Look for a shoe that is designed for motion control. These styles have a very wide sole through the arch, are stiff if you try to ""wring it out"", have a very hard ""heel counter"" and have some type of a ""medial post"" (usually a dark grey foam of higher density running along the arch sie of the foot). If you aren't comfortable with these terms then go to your local running store and ask them. If they don't know these terms then walk away - they are not trained enough to assist you. A couple of models/brands that do produce some very good shoes for overpronators (motion control shoes) are Asics (gel 2100 series), Saucony (grid stable as one example) and New Balance. Do some research on their websites and they will have pictures to describe what I've talked about.",Health,4.4494133431730616e-08

It's kinda slimy and slippery, actually, and it's meant to help the penis slide in and out of the vagina.  Without it, sex can be really painful.  That wetness varies with women, and within a single woman's lifetime.  Arousal, stress, age, time of the month- these all affect how wet a woman gets.\n\nSome women do ejaculate, too.  That substance is different from the arousal fluids, and it's not semen, either.  I don't think they know yet what exactly it is, and I've heard everything from pee to a semen-like fluid that we produce.

My grandparents barely imagined leaving their immediate area much less being able to jump on a plane and be in Europe by the end of the day or talking to someone in Asia from their bedroom computer. My point is this people have far more options today than ever before. A census is taken in the United States every ten years. They ask about jobs and homes and cars. In ten years probably a very large percentage of people drive a different car and probably a large percentage of people have a different job and live in a different home. Are we so suprised then that they live their with someone else. Our whole lives are constantly changing and we are constantly switching to adapt.

122,"Title: Evolution?why are'nt we still evolveing?where is the half man'half monkeys?, Content: , Answer: Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. This theory, which claims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was invalidated by the scientific evidence of clear ""design"" in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.\nYet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This \n""intelligent design"" is a scientific expression of the fact that God created all living things.\n\n\n(THE SCIENTIFIC COLLAPSE OF DARWINISM)\n\nAlthough this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, published in 1859. In this book, he denied that God created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an ""assumption."" Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled ""Difficulties of the Theory,"" the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. \nDarwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:\n1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. \n2) No scientific finding shows that the ""evolutionary mechanisms"" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all. \n3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests.\n\nThe power evolutionists impute to the three force they believe to have produced life—time, mud, and chance—is actually enough to elevate them into a trinity. They believe that the combination of these random forces gave shape to the human brain, intelligence, cognitive ability, judgment and memory.\nIn this section, I will examine these three basic points in general outlines:\n\n\nThe First Insurmountable Step: \n(The Origin of Life)\n\nThe theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this ""first cell"" originate?\nSince the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the ""first cell"" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement.

This would include the President. There is however no defined way for our politicians to calculate what the interests of the people are. Once in office, they exercise the powers of the office the way they see fit. As citizens we can write letters to express our interests. If enough letters are received, this may sway opinion. The constitution also grants us the right to peaceably assemble and have our grievances heard by the government.\n\nHow far we can push the administration depends on how willing the administration is to listen to its citizens. That is something important to consider when electing people to office. Once in office, politicians are very hard to remove unless they are doing something illegal. The good news is that political offices have terms and if you disagree with the administration, you will have a chance to fix it in the next election.",Politics & Government,9.706990369309677e-07

203,"Title: Do you know the name of the ""hot"" yoga?, Content: There is a type of yoga that is held in a room with a high temperature (like 102 degrees). Do you know the name of that type of yoga?, Answer: I am a conscientious but nondenominational exerciser, and coming to Bikram (a.k.a. ""Hot"") Yoga began more as a scheduling convenience than devotion to its unvarying regimen of 26 poses (asanas), each performed twice and held for what can seem like forever over the course of the nearly two-hour class. \n\nYoga comes in almost as many guises as there are yoga instructors, but most classes build on the same basic foundation of poses performed sitting, standing and lying down. Although some, like the Sun Salutation, consist of a progression of steps, more often the goal is to work gradually toward a single ideal shape: the bow, the triangle, the cobra. My needs are simple: I want supervised, intensive stretching, and every yoga class I've ever attended offers at least that. \n\nThe truth is, I hated this Bikram class when I started. At first I returned only because I was desperate — the victim of a muscle-kinking bout of business travel (cramped airline seats and strange beds). Our teacher, Leah Weisman, seemed to talk incessantly. The room was always full, from 30 to 50 people. And the space was intentionally overheated. \n\nTrue Hot Yoga requires a room temperature as high as 105°F, supposedly so muscles warm up quickly and stretch more easily. This gym's drafty old studio achieves only Balmy Yoga — about 81°F — which is just as well. I've experienced optimal Bikram temperatures just once, and frankly, that's way too much bodily fluid shared and dripped and flicked around among a bunch of people who know one another in anything less than a biblical fashion. \n\nBut the thing I hated most about the class was that at the very end, while everyone was resting for a few minutes in the stillness of Shavasana, the corpse pose (designed to quiet the mind), Leah broke into song. Classroom scuttlebutt is that she has been known to sing On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever, but I've only heard her sing verses from New Age-y folk tunes that mention planets spinning around the sun and the Earth Mother calling her children home. \n\nWhy torture myself so? Simple: love triumphs over hate. As it turns out, Leah is an excellent teacher. Week after week she goes through the same routine without ever falling into autopilot.

205,"Title: Have you ever had a mole removed?, Content: I have a mole I'd like to have removed, but my threshold for pain is close to zero. The doctor said it doesn't appear cancerous, but can only be 100% sure once the mole is removed and tested., Answer: Maybe this will help to make your desicion clearer \n\nMole Removal Introduction\n\nMoles, or nevi, are frequently removed for a variety of reasons. They can be removed by 2 surgical methods:\n\nExcision (cutting) with stitches: Click here to view step-by-step photos of this type of mole removal. \n\nExcision with cauterization (a tool is used to burn away the mole): Click here to view step-by-step photos of this type of mole removal.\nAlthough laser has been tried for moles, it is not usually the method of choice for most deep moles because the laser light doesn’t penetrate deeply enough.\nTypically, the doctor or dermatologist (a skin specialist) may choose excision with or without stitches depending on the depth of the mole and the type of cosmetic outcome desired.\n\nWhat is a mole? \n\nMany people refer to a mole as any dark spot or irregularity in the skin. Doctors use different terms. But skin marks such as these are not treated the same way moles are and are not discussed here: \n\nBirthmarks \n\nAbnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas) \n\nKeratoses (benign or precancerous spots, which appear after about age 30 years)\n\nWhat causes moles? \n\nSome people are born with moles. Other moles appear over time. \n\nSun exposure seems to play a role in the development of moles and may even play a role in the development of atypical, or dysplastic, moles. \n\nThe role of heredity cannot be underemphasized. Many families have a type of mole known as dysplastic (atypical), which can be associated with a higher frequency of melanoma or skin cancer.\nRisks\n\nRisks of mole removal methods vary from infection to anesthetic allergy and nerve damage. It is always prudent to choose a dermatologist or surgeon with appropriate skills and experience with these removals. This will decrease your risk associated with this procedure.\n\nOther risks vary depending on the area being treated and the method of removal.\nOne of the most common difficulties after mole removal is a scar. Many people will attempt to remove moles for cosmetic reasons, not realizing that each and every removal may result in a scar. Many times your surgeon can give you an idea of the type and location of a scar after mole removal before you make your decision about removal.\n\nMole Removal Preparation\n\nThe area to be treated will be cleansed. Depending on the surgeon’s preferences, this will be done either with alcohol, Betadine, or another suitable material.\nThen the area will be numbed with anesthetic, such as lidocaine. This will not usually take much time to accomplish. Many surgeons prefer to wait after numbing to allow the blood flow to the area to diminish (sometimes up to 15 minutes).\nDepending on the size of mole and method, a drape may be placed over the area to be treated.\n\nDuring the Procedure\n\nRemoval with simple cutting without stitches \n\nThe surgeon takes a scalpel and shaves the mole off flush or slightly below the level of skin.\n\nThen, either an electrical instrument will cauterize or burn the area or a solution will be placed on the area to stop any bleeding. \n\nAfter this, a topical antibiotic is placed on the wound. \n\nThe wound is then covered with a bandage. \n\nThe doctor will give you instructions on how to take care of your wound. You are usually able to leave shortly after.\n\nRemoval by cutting with stitches \n\nMoles removed by excision (cutting) with stitches are usually darker in color or flat moles or both. \n\nThe surgeon maps out the mole and then sterilizes or cleans the area and numbs it. \n\nThen a scalpel is used to cut the mole and a border surrounding the mole. The border size depends on the concern of the surgeon for the mole being removed. \n\nDepending on the depth, stitches are placed either deep (these absorb and do not have to be removed) or on the upper surface of the skin (these don’t absorb and will be removed later).\n\nAfter the Procedure\n\n\nHome care \n\nAfter the procedure, you need to keep a layer ",Health,5.4011713559155657e-08

This condition can lead to further  serious emotional problems when it is nourished by  an external reinforcement mechanisms such as the participation  in  a larger group  holding similar ideas. As an example, the evident characteristics displayed during  the  mass rallies held by Isalmists as they scream their hatred for the Americans, are  manifestations of this type of psychological degeneration. Similar behavior can be witnessed in  a group closer to us, and that would be   the minutemen who each has internalized this victimized objectification of the 'Mexican"" illegal. In this case you also have misplaced blame for whatever personal failures or fears they suppress or deny. The leaders of such groups can also be further classified into Messianic , Grandiose personality, sociopaths, whether it is Hitler or the local head of the KKK you are talking about..\nTherefore this would explain the depressive characteristics of the typical anti-undocumented.

In order for organisms to ""evolve"" there needs to be selective pressure on the ability of the organism to survive and allow it to pass its genetic material to the next generation (ie. be able to successfully breed)  For people to lose their hair there would need to be some sort of reason why we should.  For example if some sort of parasitic worm infested the earth  and and ate people who grow hair on their heads (hypothetically of course) then the people who are most likely to live and pass on their genes would be people that grow less hair.  Over time, the population would be limited to survivors of this parasitic hair loving worm, which would be people with little or no hair. That is how evolution works, just because we may not really need hair now in order to breed sucessfully, I know plenty of bald men with children, doesn't mean that nature will automatically detect this and spontaneously cause people to lose their hair over ""thousands of years"".

When a warm puck is shot off the boards it would act like a tennis ball and just bounce everywhere.  A puck with less potential energy stays down on the ice where it is easier to control and shoot.\n\nYou can try this at home.... take a baseball (or puck) and place it in the freezer for a few hours.

Extremely smooth post player ... Has excellent touch within 12 feet of the basket ... Soft hands ... Excels on the offensive end with great fundamentals and footwork ... Put on 25 pounds of muscle between his freshman and sophomore seasons and it's made him a much more aggressive and confident post player ... Runs the floor especially well for a (near) 7 footer ... Good transition player ... Good shot blocker, with his long arms he should get a fair number of blocks on the next level ... Long arms and a quick leaper ... Very versatile big man ... Has many effective moves in the low post including a go-to jump hook. Has even developed a sky hook in his sophomore year ... Great at positioning himself in the post ... Has nice form on his jumper, range is developing ... Positions himself well for rebounds and excels on the offensive glass ...\n\nWeaknesses: In high school he developed a reputation for being soft and not showing enough heart. Scouts still have some question marks about his toughness inside. He is vastly improved in that area, but still struggles against big and strong players on the NCAA level ... Not a physically imposing player inside, plays more a finesse game. Needs to get nastier ... Should still add an additional 10-15 pounds ... Not an out of this world leaper, but solid ... Not an extremely emotional player, which is both a positive and a negative ... Passing and ball handling are decent but can improve ... Also has been injury prone (missed half of his freshman year after a hip injury that required surgery) ... Must develop a killer instinct, more intensity ...

You do this by going to the security tab, selecting advanced, and unchecking [Allow inheritable permissions from the parent] when it asks what to do I usually copy the permissions and then manually remove the ones I don't want, If Domain Admins is not there add it{this is very important- if you dont leave yourself some access before you click ok, you wont have access to the folder.} then Click apply.\nAt this top level folder, turn on ABE and assign share permissions like this... \n\nAdministrators  full\ndomain admins  full\nAuthenticated users  read and change\non the security tab of the folder properties click advanced. \n\nThe only permissions you should see is allow Domain Admins(Domainname) full Control not inherited {if it shows inherited then you didn't remove all the permissions in step one} Apply to- This folder, subfolders and files. \n\nAt this point I add domain users after you browse for the user or group that you want the permission Entry for [sharename] window pops up. \n\nMake sure Apply onto: is changed to This Folder Only. This is the key to make ABE work. The only permissions that should be selected are: \n\nTraverse Folder / Execute File\nList Folder / Read Data\nRead Attributes\nRead Permissions\n\n\nThese are the permissions needed to traverse any folder under ABE. If you want everyone to see the folders under this folder you assign it to domain users, if it is only a speciffic user you assign them to that user. \n\nFor example: \ntoplevel share- {This is where we have done all the work so far}\n second level folder1{domain users get the above permissions here}\n   Third level 1a{Domain uses get full Control}\n   Third level 1b{Domain uses get full Control}\n Second level folder2{ Bob gets the above permissions here}\n   Third level 2a {Bob gets full control here}\n Second Level folder3 {Joe gets the above permissions here}\n   Third Level 3a {Joe Gets full control here} \n\nIn this scenario, both Bob and Joe can see Second level1 and the folders underneath, but only Bob can see second level 2 and under, and only Joe can see Second level 3 and under. \n\nIf you structure your folders correctly and use group permissions you can add folders in such a way that you keep your administration to a minimum. But this can get to be a real nightmare if you go to deep and have to give individuals, or groups, access all the way down the tree. \n\nIn our example above the second level1 would be seen by everyone, and then you add speciffic user or group permission the the third level 1a or b and so on. If you don't have access you can't see it. \n\nLong explanation for something that should be simple,\nThey should take some lessons from Novell on ABE. Novell handles all the permissions up the tree automatically, If you assign permissions anywhere down the tree the uplevel permissions are automatically assigned, this is where the problem lies with MS ABE if you keep your file system flat- you'll have no problems. Unfortunatly, you can't set up ABE on an existing file structure and maintain the user permissions, you would have to set up the ABE share and move the folders under the file structure you set up and reconnect them to the new share. If you do a move on the same partition the permissions will be retained, if you copy or move to a different partition/server the permissions ",Computers & Internet,4.6409772711625545e-06

240,"Title: we are paying mortgage on a empty house that is for sale is there a better solution?, Content: paying mortgage and renting an apt due to pending divoice is there a better way to handle this until the house is sold renting  is not an option, Answer: Time for getting past what caused the split and figure out how between the 2 of you to get the best value from the situation.\n\nFirst if you can, you need to lower your price.  \n\nNow use the kids ballpark divvy system.  Remember when you were a kid and had to share a candy bar with a friend.  One of you would break the candy bar in half and offer the choice to the other person as to which half they wanted.  Simple but fair and very effective.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is that you agree between yourselves that one of you will make an offer to move into the house until it sells and makes some sort of payment as rent.  Now that might be the whole payment or a partial payment, either way it should be better off than each of you paying half of the payment on a vacant house.  So the agreement is made and the offer is made, now the other person (not making the offer) has the choice of either moving back in or letting the offeror move back in.\n\nIf moving back in isn't an option for one or both of you get creative and work out some other sort of arrangement.\n\nGood luck",Business & Finance,0.0016675003700783236

What is the optimal amount to give up for the capital you need?, Answer: VC's will typical ask for at least 50-80% of a company. They are trying to gain as much control as they can.\n\nIf you're sole goal is to preserve ownership %, then the best route is to try and raise cash via friends and family at first.\n\nOnce that is exhausted try for angel capital but really limit the amount of money to what you absolutely need to purchase.\n\nAfter both of those have been exhausted approach the VC's for more significant investments, but hopefully you'll be farther along in the product development and the risk is lower to the VC because you have more tangible product, and therefore you have more leverage than you would have sans product.\n\nThere is no formula that can be applied here, it's really more about managing risk and having leverage when negotiating. Not to mention the strength of the idea and the timing and motivation for VC's to adopt the risk. If this is a hot idea in and up and coming area and you have a solid team behind you then it's easy, but if you're entering a market that is already well defined and is not attractive to the VC then it's harder.",Business & Finance,2.6029812172899007e-08

300,"Title: I'm a 19 year old girl that is afriad of a heat attack should i stop?, Content: , Answer: At the age of 19, there's practically no risk of you having a heart attack. \n\nFirst, why are you afraid that you're going to have a heart attack? Has someone in your family had a heart attack?\n\nOK, I'm going to tell you the risk factors for having a heart attack:\n\n1. Smoking - if you smoke, stop. This is the most important thing you can do for your health.\n\n2. High Blood Pressure - at the age of 19, extremely unlikely. If you want to reduce the risk, cut out salt from your diet and make sure you get plenty of exercise.\n\n3. Obesity - If you are overweight you are more at risk of heart disease. \n\n4. High cholesterol - again, very unlikely at 19. But you can help by avoiding fatty foods and getting lots of exercise.\n\n5. Family history of heart attacks in males younger than 50 or females less than 55. \n\n6. Diabetes\n\n7. Being male - females actually have protection against heart disease because of the oestrogen produced in their bodies until they reach menopause.\n\nOverall, I'd say your risk is extremely small, practically zero. But if you are worried, there are things you can do to reduce your risk even further. Don't smoke. Don't drink too much alcohol. Keep your weight at a sensible limit. Get regular exercise. Have a healthy diet, avoiding fatty foods and eating lots of fruit and veg. Try not to eat too much salt in your diet.",Health,1.307373201084463e-08

308,"Title: Who has some tips for getting power in a tennis serve?, Content: , Answer: Use as much of your body as you can - legs, back, shoulders.  Don't just toss the ball up, stand straight up, and swing your racket.  Instead, once you've tossed the ball crouch your body, bending at the knees AND the waist, as low as you reasonably can.  At the same time drop the shoulder of the arm that your racket is in as low as you can while keeping your toss arm up in the air (this will help you balance).  When the ball reaches the top of the toss, spring/uncoil your body by straighteing/uncoiling your lower body and at the same time bring your shoulder with the racket up and through the ball.  Notice ""through"", your follow through across your body is every bit as important to power (and accuracy).  Note - racket speed also has something to do with it but get this motion down first and once you've gotten comfortable with it you can work on doing it faster for even more speed.",Sports,9.673728085843143e-07

337,"Title: What are emos?, Content: Because I was just accused of being one., Answer: from the slang dictionary:\n\nGenre of softcore punk music that integrates unenthusiastic melodramatic 17 year olds who dont smile, high pitched overwrought lyrics and inaudible guitar rifts with tight wool sweaters, tighter jeans, itchy scarfs (even in the summer), ripped chucks with favorite bands signature, black square rimmed glasses, and ebony greasy unwashed hair that is required to cover at least 3/5 ths of the face at an angle.\n\n \n\nPunk music on estrogen. Often acoustic guitar with soft, high male vocals that dwell exessively on the singer's feelings, especially melancholy remembrances of past relationships/mistakes in life. A form of music that diverged from punk in the '80s, the name ""emo"" is derived from the emotive style of the lyrics and music. This genre has lately been marketed heavily by the music industry to teenagers with bands such as Dashboard Confessional and Taking Back Sunday, and has seen much commercial and mainstream success. The music has also spawned a subculture which conforms to certain conventions in dress such as tight sweatshirts, tight band T-shirts and horn-rim glasses. Adherents profess to exessively melancholy temperments. Males that adhere to the emo subculture are sometimes confused with metrosexuals; indeed the line between the two is somwhat blurred, though both groups claim to be intouch with their emotional side. The ephemeral and hackneyed nature of emo songwriting suggests that its audience will be restricted largely to teenagers. the genre suffers from a lack of credibility outside the aforementioned demographic group, much like current Nu Metal bands.\n\n \n\nAn entire subculture of people (usually angsty teens) with a fake personality. The concept of Emo is actually a vicious cycle that never ends, to the utter failing of humanity, and it goes something like this:\n\n1. Girls say they like ""sensitive guys"" (lie)\n2. Guy finds out, so he listens to faggy emo music and dresses like a dork so chicks will see that he is sensitive and not afraid to express himself (lie). He dyes his hair black, wraps himself in a stupid looking scarf, develops an eating disorder, and rants about how ""nobody understands"".\n3. Now an emo guy, he meets Emo chick and they start dating, talking about how their well-off suburban lifestyles are terrible and depressing (lie)\n4. Emo guy is just too much of a pussy. His penis is too small, he's too depressed to bathe, and has more mood swings than emo chick, and he doesn't even have a menstrual cycle. Emo chick dumps him, saying ""It's not you, it's me."" (lie) as she drives off with Wayne, the school jock and captain of the football team.\n5. Emo guy goes home and cries, proceeds to write a weak song and strum a single string on his acoustic guitar. Another emo chick sees how he is so in touch with his feelings, and the cycle continues.\n\nThis is the sad truth of the emo lifestyle/music, and now that I look at how pathetic it really is, maybe the emos DO have something to cry about!\n\nWhen she sees how sensitive and emo I have become, she'll definately go out with me!",Health,0.08322184015423713

What happens is this: You sign a contract for them to get your debtors to lower interest rates, then they decide on a lump sum you pay the credit ""counseling"" company, a part of which is a fee they take for this ""sevice"", then they divvy up that payment amoung all your creditors. You do NOT have only one creditor now! Then as long as it takes you to pay off these debts, which can be a long time, you continue to show late, non-payment, on all these accounts. They do not pay them off one by one slowly allowing you to demonstrate you are  paying them. they sit there as bad debts the entire time without much to show for all the hard work you are going to to pay off your debt. After, while it shows them as paid off, it also shows how long it took you and how long these creditors went without the money you owned them. This helps your credit very little. OH yeah one more thing, when you sign the contract you are agreeing to NOT apply for releaf under the bankrupsy law!! YOu sign away your right to do this untill these current debts are paid off!! If you fail to make your payments you also now have one more creditor that of the consumer credit counseling company you signed the contract with!! Do you know for sure what your income will be next year or the year after that or the year after that, etc?? Do you know for sure a tragic accedent or illness will not strike your familly? Do you know for certian you will continue to have your current health plan and for sure what your share of the medical bills will be? Listen if you don't know even one of these things FOR SURE then credit counseling is not for you. If you do know for sure then by all means go ahead and sign up. \n\nI highly reccomend you get online and begin looking this information up. Get information directly from a one of those so called non profit organizations and spend $100.00 at the most, often you can do this for free to speak with a bankrupsy attorney. Become fully informed, look at your situaltion, your future possible situations and then make a fuly informed decision which will be in YOUR and your families best interest. There is a lot of room in the small print section of the contact you sign with these ""counseling"" agencies. Where do you think they get their money from?

How is the North and South Pole of the Earth different from that of a magnet and moreover if in the North Pole we place a Magent with its north pole facing toward the Earth then the magnet should flip, but i think it doesn't happen, but why. And explain why the magnets north pole always point toward the north pole of the Earth, of course not exactly but there is some angle present between the poles of a magnet and that of the Earth. Can someone very good explain these all to me., Answer: First: Gravity is due to mass, while magnetism is due to the movement of an electric charge.  For earth, this is believed to be caused by the movement of ions within the earth, the magma near the core.\n\nSecond: The poles of a magnet were misnamed.  They named the poles of a magnet because of the direction they pointed.  However, once the properties of magnetism were truly understood, it was too late.  So, appropriately, it could be said that near the north pole is the south magnetic pole, but I'm sure most teachers would frown upon that assertion.\n\nOther notes about magnetism on earth: The earth is imperfect.  The magnetic field is not uniform, so there are variations.  Magnetic north is not geographic north in all situations.  The earth is tilted, and we don't really know the flow of the magma that causes the magnetic field all that well.  Not to mention, there is speculation that magnetic north and south may flip at some point in time, but the mechanism of this is lost on me.  It has happened a very long time ago, and is expected to happen again sometime in the future.",Science & Mathematics,1.0884219240772176e-08

But if you imagine hitting a ball straight on (with no english...no spin), then the natural angle (after hitting a second ball) will carry the ball off the tangent at the point the two balls made contact, while the second ball will travel at a right angle from the tangent.  In other words, picture in your mind you just just shot the cue ball at the 9 ball.  Got it in your head?  Now slow it down to the point where the two balls make contact and pause.  Now, if you don't know anything about tangent lines, I've got some info below.  Basically, a tangent line touches a circle (like the balls) in ONLY one point.  When the two balls hit, the first ball will travel along the tangent, while the second ball will always travel at a right angle.  Again, this is WITHOUT any spin, which will either increase or decrease the angle of the path of the balls.  That's one way you can control the balls and use them to your advantage, but you can start with learning the natural angles.  Practice...you'll get it.

That particular year was notable because the National Hockey League (NHL) had a labour stoppage due to contract negotiations between the league and the players. Many professional hockey players who could not play in the NHL chose to play in Europe or in other North American leagues. The largest number of professional NHL players were in Sweden. This increased the quality of play dramatically and many observers said that the Elitserien was the best league in the world during 2004–2005, with Frölunda HC being the best team in the league.\n\nAlthough their home arena is the Scandinavium, when it is occupied by other events they play home games at Frölundaborg (capacity 9,200)\n\nFounded: 1944 \nHome arena: Scandinavium (capacity 12,044) \nSwedish Championships won: 3 (1965, 2003, 2005)",Science & Mathematics,1.449434364243001e-08

The search engine allows one to ask for content meeting specific criteria (typically those containing a given word or phrase) and retrieves a list of items that match those criteria.

Without further qualification, search engine usually refers to a Web search engine, which searches for information on the public Web. Other kinds of search engine are enterprise search engines, which search on intranets, personal search engines, which search individual personal computers, and mobile search engines. Different selection and relevance criteria may apply in different environments, or for different uses.\n\nSome search engines also mine data available in newsgroups, large databases, or open directories like DMOZ.org.

Email me anytime at ryanfrancisbailey@yahoo.com Alternative names   \n\n\nInfantile eczema; Atopic eczema; Dermatitis - atopic \nDefinition    Return to top \n\nAtopic dermatitis, commonly referred to as eczema, is a chronic skin disorder categorized by scaly and itching rashes. People with eczema often have a family history of allergic conditions like asthma, hay fever, or eczema.\n\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors    Return to top \n\nEczema is most common in infants, and at least half of those cases clear by age 3. In adults, it is generally a chronic or recurring condition.\n\nA hypersensitivity reaction (similar to an allergy) occurs in the skin, causing chronic inflammation. The inflammation causes the skin to become itchy and scaly. Chronic irritation and scratching can cause the skin to thicken and become leathery-textured.\n\nExposure to environmental irritants can worsen symptoms, as can dryness of the skin, exposure to water, temperature changes, and stress.\n\nSymptoms    Return to top \n\nIntense itching \nBlisters with oozing and crusting \nSkin redness or inflammation around the blisters \nRash \nIn children under 2 years old, skin lesions begin on the cheeks, elbows, or knees \nIn adults, the rash more commonly involves the inside surfaces of the knees and elbows \nDry, leathery skin areas \nMore or less pigment than their normal skin tone (see skin, abnormally dark or light) \nLocated commonly in the inner elbow or behind the knee \nMay spread to the neck, hands, feet, eyelids, or behind the knee \nRaw areas of the skin -- from scratching \nEar discharges/bleeding \nSigns and tests    Return to top \n\nDiagnosis is primarily based on the appearance of the skin and on personal and family history. The health care provider should examine the lesions to rule out other possible causes. A skin lesion biopsy may be performed, but is not always required to make the diagnosis.\n\n\nTreatment    Return to top \n\nConsult your health care provider for a diagnosis of eczema because it can be difficult to differentiate from other skin disorders. Treatment should be guided by the health care provider.\n\nTreatment may vary depending on the appearance (stage) of the lesions -- acute ""weeping"" lesions, dry scaly lesions, or chronic dry, thickened lesions are each treated differently.\n\nAnything that aggravates the symptoms should be avoided whenever possible, including any food allergens and irritants such as wool and lanolin.\n\nDry skin often makes the condition worse. When washing or bathing, keep water contact as brief as possible and use less soap than usual. After bathing, it is important to trap the moisture in the skin by applying lubricating cream on the skin while it is damp. Temperature changes and stress may cause sweating and aggravate the condition.\n\nTreatment of weeping lesions may include soothing moisturizers, mild soaps, or wet dressings.\n\nMild anti-itch lotions or topical corticosteroids (low potency) may soothe less severe or healing areas, or dry scaly lesions.\n\nChronic thickened areas may be treated with ointments or creams that contain tar compounds, corticosteroids (medium to very high potency), and ingredients that lubricate or soften the skin. Systemic corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation in some severe cases.\n\nThe latest treatment for eczema is a class of skin medications called topical immunomodulators (TIMs). These medications are steroid-free. They include tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Studies have shown as high as an 80% success rate using these new medications.\n\nExpectatio",Health,6.159779176674881e-08

449,"Title: Why do people say Israel stole the land they live on, when Moses led them out of Egypt?, Content: That was their promised land, right?  And being a Christain that will be my home some day., Answer: Not only were the Jews there before the Palestineans, but they also purchased the land from Arabs when they settled there. The Arabs want to kill the Jews to take the land and they killed other Arabs who sold land to Jews. Originally the area of Palestine was divided by the UN into the Arab area of Jordan and the Jewish area of Israel. The rulers of Jordan wouldn't take the Palestinians into their country as they felt they would make trouble so they ended up in camps and were brought up to think they should kill the Jews to get the land from them. Many of them left Israel in 1948 when the state of Israel was created because in the broadcasts the other Arab countries told them that if they left and supported the Arab attackers that they could get the property of their Jewish neighbors after they were killed. When the Arabs lost, these people were stuck. The other Arabs did not give them a place to live. They left them there because they knew they would make trouble for Israel, they did not help them as fellow human beings and Muslims.\nThe Arabs who stayed kept their land, got modern medical care, plumbing and electricity and education, including college education. Villages were literally split in half in 1948 when the UN divided everything in half to form the two countries. In 1967 when the Israelis recaptured some of this land after being attacked by the Arabs, many of the Arabs on the Israel side of the border didn't want to have anything to do with the Arabs on the other side because many of them were uneducated and backward. \nThe land of Israel, by the way, was a desert and the Jews planted trees and irrigated it and made it a good place to live. They used to give jobs to the Palestinians, but they killed the Jews so they don't hire them anymore and are building a wall to keep them out so they don't come over and set off bombs in restaurants like they did yesterday. The Hamas, who are the government of the Palestineans, praised the bombing. If people were coming across our borders and bombing us, we'd build a wall too.\nWhen the Arabs ask for land back they also look at what's there. The Israelis had a five star famous resort on a little point of land called Taba that brought in a lot of money. The Egyptians asked for that and got it in 1988. They wanted it because it was a fancy resort that tourists flocked to from all over the world. There is nothing else there but the resort. The part of Jerusalem they want is full of very expensive nice condos, many over $500,000 that people paid for like we pay for our condos. I wouldn't want someone to give my house away.\nBy the way, the other Muslim countries also don't want the Israeli Arabs in their countries because the women are educated and have equal rights. They don't want them to spread ideas of equality to their women. In some Muslim countries women can't even drive a car.",Politics & Government,7.77962292312151e-06

457,"Title: Traditionally, the conservative viewpoint follows the idea that all is created by god.?, Content: If that were truly believed, why does the conservative viewpoint not place much emphasis about environmentalism or the health(care) and safety of everyone?  Is that not blatant disrespect for god - to, in essense, eventually deplete and destroy what was divinely given to humans?  Whatever happened to love thy neighbor...?, Answer: First, it seems that many of you are taking the ""conservative viewpoint"" to heart - I don't think that it means each and every single person who might align themself with the conservative thinking just as one can't make a generalization about each and every single liberal.  While I can't be sure of the actual intent of the question, it doesn't sound like it is implying that EVERY SINGLE PERSON who calls themself conservative believes that.  \n\nIt seems that in the same way conservatives are misunderstood, so are liberals, and socialists, and marxists, and moderates, etc.  \n\nSecond, Heidi 4, ""you want everything to be given to you"" is a huge assumption, I would say.  Clearly nothing comes for free, ESPECIALLY in the United States, but does that mean that we, as a nation, can't figure out a way to provide at least basic healthcare for all at a reasonable cost (to all), or stop depending on oil so heavily?  A few European countries have amazing universal health for hardly the cost that we pay for an uninsured hospital visit.  Technology to decrease our dependence on oil has been invented but is being held back from the public...but why?\n\nThirdly, a few mentioned dedicating your life to service.  How unoriginal.  Love thy neighbor doesn't mean dedicate your life to servitude but to give respect to all - whether you agree with them or not, everyone is a human being with thoughts and feelings and opinions and different life experiences.  \n\nFinally, concerning ""deplete and destroy what was divinely given to humans"" is actually a very interesting point.  This can be pinned to everyone regardless of religious affiliation but it does seem the most contradictory for those who do believe that god created all.  It's a slap in the face saying, ""You gave it all to us and you gave us brains-  ha ha ha- we sure can't take care of it because we all want money which is something that humans invented, not you!

If you are reasonably numerate (top 75 percentile) and logical/methodical in your approach to problem solving it isn't difficult at all.\n\nThe hard part is maintaining interest in your studies, as some segments of the qualifications can be very dull.\n\nThere are many different types of accountancy work.  Management accounting, financial accounting, bursarial work, advisory, forensic, audit.... the list goes on.  \n\nIt is a good career path, and if you take a good combination course, with a management element you may well be able to move into other work.  Most senior officers in local government and Chief Executives started their careers in accountancy.\n\nIf you are seriously considering a post graduate course in accountancy the main options are:\n\nCIMA - Chartered Institute of Management Accountants - good generic course with strong management element, liked by business and local government.\nhttp://www.cimaglobal.com/cps/rde/xchg/live/root.xsl/index.htm\nCIPFA - Chartered Institute of Public Finance Accountants - again good management element, but predominantly for those wanting a career in local government.\nhttp://www.cipfa.org.uk/\nACCA - Association of Chartered Certified Accountants - generally preferred option for practice accountants\nhttp://uk.accaglobal.com/\n\nYou could enter the career by working for one of the 'big four', KPMG, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Ernst&Young.  Or any number of other firms, or you could apply for a trainee post within local government.  You should expect to take three or four years to qualify, but the financial rewards are high.\n\nBefore you leap into the career wholeheartedly, why don't you try getting a Summer job in an accounts office, or ask local firms/councils for some work experience to give you an idea of what's involved.\n\nPersonally I drifted into finance by accident, I've spent 10 years advising non-financial managers on all aspects of financial rules and regulations and the customer facing aspects of the job gave me great satisfaction.  I've done some audit/forensic accounting, which is brilliant if you like problem solving and puzzles.  Now I'm using that experience in a general management position.\n\nGood luck, whatever you decide to do....just remember that there's more to life than work.

It also makes you feel very good.\n\nThat is why most typically feel better when they are in shape or getting there. \n\nIt only last certain periods of time, usually for a day or two. When it runs out (usually a day after a good workout) you will feel it. Your body is the same, but you feel it more two days later because the endorphins wear off.\n\nMake sure you stay hydrated constantly hours before, just before, during, just after, and hours after your work out. \n\nEAT A BANANA BEFORE YOUR WORKOUT!!!!\nThe potassium will give a very noticable boost, and help with cramps.\n\nEAT SOMETHING SALTY AFTER YOUR WORKOUT!!!!!!\nThe salt will trap water into your muscles that move in when your muscles stretch and keep it there, maintaining your swollen state.\n\nNEVER EVER DRINK CAFFEINE OR ALCOHOL AFTER!!!!\nThey sap water from you body and you will ruin your workout as if you never did it.",Health,1.1648893657278201e-07

With ethanol, the best you can get is 95% purity, the remaining 5% is water. There are cheap zeolites and hygroscopic salts such as CaCl2 or NaOH available which can further reduce the amount of water. If you are still not happy, you can get absolute alcohols by using magnesium. And magnesium ribbons or turnings are relatively cheap, too. Place (50-100 g) magnesium in a flask, put some amount of alcohol just to cover the magnesium. Leave for a few hours until you see white magnesium alkoxide being formed on the surface of the metal. Caution: exothermic reaction. Use the tallest distillation column you can find. Do not stir the mixture. Just leave it there. When you have now a lot of magnesium alkoxide you can add more alcohol (up to 2 liters). The alkoxide will destroy any water in the alcohol and you now can distill off your absolute alcohols. For methanol and ethanol, formation of the alkoxide takes only a few hours. For other alcohols, you might need to activate the magnesium by adding some solid iodine and heating to activate the magnesium. Don't distill to dryness. The remaining alkoxide reacts violently with water. Use alcohol-water mixture when disposing them. Sounds fun, doesn't it? =)",Science & Mathematics,8.316855089929676e-06

548,"Title: whats the best exercise to do to get rid of a beer belly?, Content: , Answer: Hi, there, to lose weight, the best thing is to do cardiovascular exercises like biking, jogging, walking at a fast pace...You are supposed to do them on an empty stomach in the morning or in the evening. The reason why we do it on an empty stomach is bcos u dont hav any food in ur body that it needs fuel to get energy for u to do that exercise.. Then, your body resorts to burning the body fat as a fuel. Do cardio for 40-45 mins 6-7 times a week. But, note this that cardio takes 30% and diet takes 70%. So eat 4-5 small meals a day which contains low carbs, high quality protein ( lean read meat such as chicken breast, turky, tuna ) and some vegetables. By eating smaller meals more frequently the metabolism become fast. Of course, it must be healthy, not junk food. And avoid eating sugary food , sweets and the likes. Try to hav less stress ( just try to think that argument or whatever problem is not gonna kill u that you dont really hav to care much, for example). And try to get restful sleep around 7 hrs a day. SO, that is everything u hav to do. You will see the difference in 2-3 mths if u follow them strictly. \n\nBut, truth be told that alcohol , beer is very fattening  and it decreases ur testosterone level resulting in estrogen increase which encourage ur body to gather more and more fat. So, quit drinking beer. Good Luck !",Health,1.8023188105863576e-08

564,"Title: Why do we blush when we get embarrassed or shy?, Content: Why do we get red?, Answer: Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our ""fight or flight"" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. \nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. As a result of the ""fight or flight"" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. \n\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. \n\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness\n\n(author of ""Peace From Nervous Suffering"") says, ""a blush is caused by the nerves controlling the blood vessels in our face and neck becoming so startled by emotion - fear, anger, shame - that they suddenly release their grip and blood floods into the vessels."" Trying NOT to blush makes it that much worse!",Education & Reference,0.059523992679470804

First, I'll address your question.  The truth is I have no idea, but who cares?  South Park is the best show ever made, but with all that time off, Trey Parker and Matt stone have time to bring us other things, such as Team America!!\n\nAnyway, it's not because animated shows take a long time to create; it only takes the SP crew six days from start to finish.  This is because every little detail is done in-house.  Family guy, for example, has to ship its work off to Korea, where it is animated.  \n\nAlso, the animation doesn't ""suck;"" they use state-of-the-art animation software; it looks the way it does because that's part of the charm.\n\nFinally, I just want to give a quick shout-out to all the South Park haters out there who think the show is stupid just because they make fun of everyone.

586,"Title: i am 200pds n want to lose weight but have no will power/determination...HELP!!?, Content: , Answer: I have been on a quest to lose weight and I have tried all sorts of things, but the best way is calorie counting.  Let's see if you are 200 you eat around 2640cals a day to maintain that weight.  For each lb you want to lose you have to eat 500cals less than you would daily.\n\nI'm always tring to lose weight, and i'm a chocolate addict, I bought a food journal and I've wrote in it 21days today.  I started at 197 and I'm down to 190.  Sometimes I cheat, but I still write it down.  I don't drink any kind of drinks, and I haven't since I was little.  I barely drink juice, juice the 1/2the calories oj.  But count your calories, try to snack on fruits or veggies, I must is water i drink at least 2 liter bottles a day.  This will make you not feel so hungry, I make sure I drink alot while i'm eating.  If you don't like the taste of water, use the crytral lite stuff or the fruit flavored water at walmart.  If you don't drink enough water or eat to much salt you can retain water which makes you heavier.  \n\nI bought a neoprene belt, I don't get alot of exercise so I wear it when i go grocery shopping, it makes you sweat alot around your belly, helping get rid of it.  I also made sure i had measuring cups, food scales, and I go on calorieking.com, they have a database where i search for what i'm about to eat and find out how many calories it has in it.  \n\nIn the grocery store i stopped buying the things i usually get that has the most calories.  If i don't see it in the kitchen, i don't want it.  I buy parkay spray butter, it is so yummy, it has no calories.  Wonder bread lite has only 40 calories per slice, now anytime in the store i look at the label and i think about how bad it is for me and put it back.  I have one cabinet in my kitchen that only has snack foods and nothing else.  So when i'm cooking I won't have to get anything out, I used to keep snacks on the top of the frige, that wasn't a good thing at all.  They have 100 calorie packs now, those are really yummy, but i love the ""gripz"" the keebler choc chip cookie kind are great, and only 120cals, they're really tiny cookies, so i eat a couple at a time and they last much longer than the 100cal packs.  \n\nA great jumpstart to a diet is the juice diet, there's celebrity juice diet and hollywood.  Hollywood you get at walmart.  Celebrity at gnc.  It's a two day diet and when i used it a few months ago i lost 6lbs.  The bottle say up to 10lbs in 2 days.  I literally shrinks your stomach, so after the two days, so can't hold as much food.  The celebrity in the orange bottle tastes best, it's like really sweet pineapple orange juice.  If you decide to do the juice diet be careful, i usually cheat on the diet a little, like a piece of toast w/no cal butter or a few crackers.  See the diet is just juice and water for two days, I usually get light headed, so i eat a little on it.  I have no will power too, so you just have to keep yourself busy where you're not thinking about food.

When a piece of cloth or paper is wet, it absorbs water which fills in the spaces between the fibers.  Water reflects mostly in the blue spectrum, so that adds to the total light which is reflected by the object.

This time period was followed by the civilizations of the Minoan and Mycenaean kings. Next came the Dark Ages which was a time period characterized by many wars and invasions. Greece was then invaded by the Dorians in approximately 1100 BC. Finally, in the period from 500-336 BC Greece was divided into small city states. A city-state consisted of a city and its surrounding countryside. \n\n\nChronology\n\n6000 - 2900 BC Neolithic Period \n2900-2000 BC Early Bronze Age \n2000-1400 BC Minoan Age \n1600-1100 BC Mycenaean Age \n1100-750 BC The Dark Ages \n750-500 BC Archaic Period \n500-336 BC Classical Period \n336-146 BC Hellenistic Period \n\n\nhttp://www.cedarville.edu/academics/education/resource/schools/chca/othergrades/greecetd/greece1.htm\n--------------\n3000 BC In early Bronze Age settlers from Asia Minor came to the island and fused with earlier Neolithic occupants to develop what is known as the Early Cycladic culture. They worked in marble and stone and traded over sea.\n\n1600 BC During the Late Bronze Age Siphnos was under the cultural andcommercial hegemony of the Minoans of Crete. It is believed that theCretans founded the town named Minoa but remains are as yet undiscovered.\n\nIn 1400 BC the explosion of Santorini destroyed the major centers of Minoan civilization the Mycenaeans became the dominant power in the area and used the islands as relay staions to the near east, replacing many of the indigenous people with Greeks.\n\nAt about 1100 BC during the dark days of the Dorian Invasion, Sifnos was colonized by Ionians from Attika, led by their chieftan Alkenor who became the islands first sovereign.\n\nIn the 8th century BC Greeks began to think of themselves as an ethnic unity. City States began to grow up on the mainland and the islands. Sifnos was under the domination of neighboring Milos. It was then that Gold was discovered on the island and the inhabitants became quite rich, paving their capital in Parian Marble and building a treasury in Delphi. It was said that every year the Sifniots would present a solid golden egg to the God Apollo. One year out of guilt they gave him an egg that was merely plated in Gold. The angry God destroyed their mines. It was also during this period that Samian pirates plundered the island. With the riches they took, they aquired the island of Hydra for their home. When the mines of Sifnos brought forth no more precious metal the island was reduced to poverty.\n\nIn the fifth century BC Sifnos was part of the Greek alliance of City states that defeated the Persians at Marathon, Salamis and Platea. Sifnos became a part of the Delian League and came under the authority of Athens. During the Peleponisian wars, Sifnos managed to stay out of the conflict. In 338 it fell under the influence of Phillip of Macedonia. When Persians captured it in 332 Alexander the Great sent a squadron to expell them. When Alexander died and the empire was devided among his generals, Sifnos fell under the influence of the Ptolemies of Egypt until 146bc when they fell to the Romans.\n\nhttp://www.greektravel.com/sifnos/history.htm",Education & Reference,0.0003362610855325126

The information contained in these summaries was originally collected in 1997 to put together a printed brochure for patients, families and health care professionals.  Although these summaries are now 6 or 7 years old, they have been re-reviewed and we believe  contain basic and general information that is still helpful to patients and families today.\n\n \nWhile the entity of the ""athlete's heart"" has been recognized for over 100 years, only in the last two decades has the application of echocardiography and other noninvasive imagine techniques permitted definition with some precision of the alterations in cardiac dimensions associated with athletic conditioning.  Echocardiography has demonstrated that long-term athletic training leads to an increase in left ventricular (LV) mass due to increases in LV diastolic cavity dimension, wall thickness, or both.  These changes in cardiac morphology are relatively mild in absolute terms, and the differences between athlete and non-athlete populations are statistically significant but generally small.  Furthermore, cardiac alterations associated with training differ somewhat depending on the particular sporting discipline in which the individual athlete participates.  In particular, the changes in LV wall thickness, cavity dimensions, or both associated with long-term athletic training may be more striking in certain sports such as distance running, swimming, cycling and rowing/canoeing.  It is in athletes raining in such sports that the differential diagnosis is more likely to be raised.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n \nDilated Cardiomyopathy\nIn an important minority of athletes, the increase in LV end-diastolic cavity dimension that occurs with training overlaps that which is characteristic of certain pathologic entities.  While LV cavity dimension is athletes is usually in the range of 53 to 58 mm, in some individuals it may extend into what is regarded as the pathological range of >60 mm (up to 70 mm), and thereby resemble dilated cardiomyopathy.  However, the absence of LV systolic dysfunction is usually sufficient to distinguish such physiologic ventricular enlargement induced by training from dilated cardiomyopathy. \n\nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD)\nBecause highly trained athletes may demonstrate right ventricular enlargement and a variety of depolarization, repolarization and conduction abnormalities on the ECG, the differential diagnosis between athlete's heart and ARVD may arise.  Identification of ARVD by echocardiography may be exceedingly difficult because of technical limitations in imaging right heart morphology (and assessing right ventricular function), and also because the spectrum of disease is broad.  Demonstration of right ventricular segmental or global dysfunction or substantial cavity enlargement supports the diagnosis.  Magnetic resonance imaging, however, affords a more reliable noninvasive diagnosis of this condition.  In ARVD, ECG's frequently show T wave inversion in V1-V3.\n\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\nThe dilemma of distinguishing clinically between athlete's heart and structural heart disease most frequently arises with respect to hypetrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  While at present there is no single approach that will definitively resolve this question in all such athletes, several strategies are described here that alone or in combination offer a large measure of clarification in most instances for this often compelling differential diagnosis.  The definition of HCM employed here is that of a patient (or athlete) with evidence of a hypertrophied and nondilated LV in the absence of another cardiac of systemic disease that could itself produce hypetrophy of the magnitude present in that individual.\n\nWall Thickness\nIn",Health,5.675826488666527e-07

They are often benign, meaning they won't harm you.  They can occur because of drugs, including caffeine, diet pills, supplements, etc, because of medical problems such a high thyroid levels or electrolyte imbalances, because of significant medical problems, and also without any apparent ""reason"".  The medical tests performed for irregular heart beats includes EKGs, holter monitors to record your heart rhythm, event monitors and more.  These tests are performed to find out if there is a cause of the irregularity that needs to be ""fixed"".  The results are also used to predict whether any harm is likely to come to you, because of the irregular rhythm.  Many irregular rhythms do not require any treatment.  \nPalpitations are the SENSATION that your heart is beating too fast, too hard, too slow, or irregularly.  You can have palpitations with a totally regular heart rhythm.  They can also be caused by irregular rhythms, both dangerous ones AND non-dangerous ones.

672,"Title: What are the benefits of using a permanent magnets for field excitation on a generator/turbine?, Content: , Answer: I have a small wind turbine which uses permanent magnets instead of a field coil.  The main benefit I can see is in keeping the electronics on the ground.  As the wind speed increases, the output voltage (and power) from the generator will increase as well.  I have a shunt regulator at the batteries to prevent overcharging.  Everything outside on the tower is very simple and less likely to break.  Other than mechanical breakdown, repairs to the system can usually be made on the ground level.\n\nOn a gasoline powered generator, sometimes permanent magnets are turned inside the AC output coils.  This eliminates the need for brushes and the voltage regulator board.  AC output coils have been designed to supply 120VAC at 3600RPM.  If the engine speed changes, the output voltage will change as well.  Output voltage will also change with load variations.\n\nI have more generator information online.\nhttp://members.rennlist.org/warren/genfaq.html\nhttp://members.rennlist.org/warren/generator.html",Science & Mathematics,0.0008125528121965535

675,"Title: why must a business owner manage information as a resource?, Content: , Answer: Because it is a resource in the sense that a business can profit from it.  A business can profit from the information it possesses by selling it (if allowed legally) and by improving its processes using insights it derives from them.\n\nAn example of selling information is a company selling a database of its client base.  The more information this database contains, the more valuable it will be.

It was less expensive then a single family residence and I was able to purchase it for less down and ability to qualify.  It gave me time to gain equity through appreciation, ultimately sell to purchase a single family residence.\n\nThe con side would be lack of control.  The homeowners dues increased.  A vote was taken on a special assessment I did not agree with but had to pay anyway.  Noisy neighbors & a legal battle with the developer which was very costly to every owner in the project.\n\nThe positive side as stated above was the ability to get a start.\n\nThe positive side of owning a single family residence is pretty obvious. Complete ownership of both land and home.(with a condo you own your unit and a % of the common areas)\nAbility to landscape using your own creativity.  Unless there are master CC&R's for the neighborhood you have control about exterior color. And typically a single family residence will appreciate at a faster pace than a condominium.

693,"Title: Who can explain about Klein bottle?, Content: I realy can not figure it out., Answer: The first problem is that a true Klein bottle cannot be made in three dimensions. The ones you can buy are 'Klein bottles with a hole'. \n\nTo make a Klein bottle, let's first make a torus (a bagel shape). Start with a circular cylinder, and label the two circles on top and on bottom with little arrows pointing the same direction around the cylinder. Then glue those circles together so that the arrows go together. This is a torus.\n\nNow do the same thing, only have the circles go in opposite directions around the cylinder. You will find that to glue the circles together, you would have to push through the side of the cylinder and glue from underneath. If you imagine cutting a little hole so this can be done, you have a Klein bottle with a hole! Now imagine filling in the hole, but *not* causing any intersections. Again, this can't be done in three dimensions, but it can in four. THe result is a true Klein bottle.\n\nThere is a misunderstanding that non-orientable surfaces are always one-sided. This depends strongly on what space they are imbedded in! When in Euclidean space, this is correct, but if they are imbedded in another non-orientable space, they can be two-sided there. Non-orientability has to do with whether there is a way to get a consistent 'circulation pattern' over the whole surface.",Science & Mathematics,1.07994136777151e-08

701,"Title: what do you think of george bush?, Content: j/w cuz i think he sucks @ being the president, espiceally after 9-11, Answer: Hes a baaad man. Here are some reasons:\n25 REASONS TO FEEL BAD ABOUT BUSH\n\nEconomic Indicators\n\n1. The unemployment rate averaged 4.1 percent in 2000 and reached a 30 year low of 3.9 percent in October 2000. Today, the unemployment rate has increased to 5.7 percent. There are presently 8.1 million unemployed Americans, an increase of 2.5 million compared to 2000\n\n2. The number of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment-over 27 weeks-has almost doubled in the last year.\n\n3. Job creation has reversed. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the economy created 1.7 million new jobs. This trend has been reversed, and the economy has lost almost 1.5 million jobs since President Bush took office in January 2001.\n\n4. Poverty is increasing. After decreasing for eight straight years and reaching its lowest level in 25 years, the poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 11.7 percent in 2001. In the first year of the Bush administration, 1.3 million Americans slipped back into poverty, with a total of 32.9 million Americans living in poverty in 2001.\n\n5. Incomes are falling. After increasing every year since 1991, and reaching an all time high in 2000, median household income in the United States fell 2.2 percent in 2001. Median incomes fell for households in every income group in the country except for those earning over $150,000.\n\n6. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are filing for bankruptcy. Almost 800,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2002. In the second quarter of 2002, over 400,000 bankruptcies were filed in the United States, an all-time record.\n\n7. Mortgage foreclosures are at record highs. In the second quarter of 2002, 1.23 percent of home loans were in the foreclosure process, a record level. Over this same time period, almost 5 percent of mortgage loans were delinquent, up almost 20 percent from the average delinquency rate in 2000.\n\n8. The federal budget deficit is increasing. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the federal budget, excluding Social Security, showed a surplus of $86.6 billion. The most recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that for FY 2002, the federal budget, excluding Social Security, will show a deficit of $314 billion.\n\n9. This represents the largest budget decline in U.S. history, and it is the third-largest on-budget deficit in history, exceeded in size only by the deficits of 1991 and 1992 under the first President Bush. Health Care Indicators\n\n10.The number of Americans without health insurance is increasing. Between 1999 and 2000, the number of uninsured Americans fell by 600,000.\n\n11. But this trend has reversed itself and in 2001 the number of uninsured Americans increased by 1.4 million.\n\n12. Over 41 million Americans — 14.6 percent of the population — had no health insurance coverage in 2001.\n\n13. The percentage of small businesses offering insurance to their employees fell by 10 percent between 2000 and 2002.\n\n14. Insurance costs increased by 12.7 percent in 2002, the second consecutive year of double-digit increases and the largest annual increase in costs since 1990.\n\n15. Prescription drug prices increased by almost twice the rate of inflation in 2001.\n\n16. For seniors, who use the most prescription drugs, cost increases were even higher. The cost of the 50 most popular drugs for seniors increased by 7.8 percent in 2001, over three times the rate of inflation. The price of Prilosec, the most popular drug for seniors, increased at over four times the rate of inflation.\n\nCrime and Drug Use Indicators\n\n17.The crime rate is increasing. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the crime rate reached its lowest level since 1972. This represented the culmination of a 22 percent decrease in crime during the 1990s.\n\n18. But in 2001, the crime rate increased by 2.2 percent. The murder rate increased by 3.1 percent, the robbery rate increased by 3.9 percen",Politics & Government,4.74331286237547e-07

Cherrapunji in the State of Meghalaya has for long been regarded the rainiest place in the world. Its annual mean rainfall based on the 30 years data (1931-60) is 1156.5 cm while that based on longer-term data (1851-1960) is 1131.4 cm. Later it was claimed that Waileale in the island of Kauai in Hawaii (USA) could be the rainiest place with an annual mean rainfall of 1168.4cm based on 32 years data (1931-62). Soon after it was noted that the annual mean rainfall at Mawsynram (Meghalaya) was 1187.3cm based on 39 years data (1941-1979).

No question about it; He did get the title. Tim Sylvia has heart and determination but not the natural ability. His time is growing short. \n\n\n2nd - Brandon Vera is easily the next heavyweight champion. Vera is the total package with speed, power, and unbelievable ground game and so versatile on his feet. Watch his fight with Fabiano Scherner. He switched leads and stances about every 4 seconds with incredible footwork. One of his coach's, Lloyd Irvin is one of the best in the training business.  \n\nHis recent defeats are all considered at the top of the division:\n Win Frank Mir TKO (Strikes) --- Former Heavyweight Champion\n Win Assuerio Silva Submission (Guillotine Choke)\n Win Justin Eilers KO (Kick and Knee)\n Win Fabiano Scherner TKO (Knees)\n Win Mike Whitehead TKO (Injury)\n\nand let's keep in mind that Vera is young.

728,"Title: teaching hours?, Content: How many hours do pupils stay in primary school per week in USA?How about the teachers? Are they paid well enough as to run a nice living????, Answer: In primary (elementary) school, students attend about 6 hours per day, and teachers 7.5 hours per day.  Students attend 180 days (40 weeks counting partial weeks for holidays), and teachers 182 (2 extra days for in-service training, etc.) on their contract.\n\nHowever, the teacher's ""contract"" time tells only part of the story. Teachers are required to continue professional development, including taking college courses, throughout their careers. We also have lots of paperwork to do, that adds up to 1 to 3 hours per day extra time.\n\nThere are many schools, as well, that are going to year-round schedules rather than having a long summer break.\n\nRegardless of how the breaks are spread, teachers continue to work through them. Currently, during my summer break, I am putting together additional center activities for my class next year. I am also taking a college class toward a second Master's Degree (my first M.A. is in special education). \n\nTeaching is a full-time, year-round job, for half the pay of other professions that have similar training and professional requirements.\n\nThe average teaching salary last year for 1st year teachers was around $29,500.  Overall, for all teachers at all levels of experience and training, it was around $46,000.  This is the ""gross"" pay, before taxes, health and life insurance, mandatory retirement deductions, professional organization fees, etc. Take-home pay is a little more than half of gross pay.",Education & Reference,2.990424743445133e-07

We are in a lot of scenes together. I've known him for a few years now from previous plays, but it's been a really long time since I've seen him last. He's a year older than me- I'm fifteen, he's sixteen. We go to different schools.

I don't know if I should just hang back and let him come to me, but do you think he ever will? Sometimes we catch each other's eye and then we both look away., Answer: Most people like to talk about themselves, give him a chance. If you're worried about his friends interfering or making you uncomfortable, send him an email. Ask for some personal info, but keep it friendly. This way, he doesn't feel like he has respond right away, and he might be nervous about talking to you in person.

The angle of depression of the boat is 3 degrees. How far is the boat from the shoreline?, Answer: ALWAYS draw a picture if you are having trouble.  Draw a vertical line - this is your tower.  Label it 60 (the height of the tower).  From the base of the tower, draw a line straight to the left.  This is the distance to the boat, so label it x.  Go ahead and close up the hypotenuse. Now you have a right triangle.\n\nThe angle of depression from the top of the tower = the angle of elevation of the boat = 3degrees.  This goes in the lower-lefthand corner of the triangle.  Now you have an angle, and you have values for the opposite side, and the adjacent side.  So which trig function uses opposite and adjacent?  Tangent.\n\ntan = opp/adj.\ntan(3) = 60/x\nxtan(3)=60\nx=60/tan(3) = approx 1144.87 feet\n\nThis site has some good illustrations for the chapter you are working on.

You could then chose one of the independend variables and try to design an experiment that shows how varying that variable causes a change in warming.  an example might be saying that CO2 causes global warming by increasing the insulating value of the atmosphere, you could then set up an experiment where an environment(a large sealed environment(5 gallon glass jug)  is set up to permit differnet concentrations of CO2.  Add a radiating heat source like a heat lamp and heat the closed environment,  measure the inside of the environment and then turn off the light.  graph how long it takes for the environment to return to ambiant tempeture.  increase the CO2 concentration and try it again.

767,"Title: How are the points scored in Nascar racing...?, Content: like Jimmy Johnson is leading in the points right now. Please explain., Answer: Ok I am a huge NASCAR fan and the point system is kind of confusing. But I am sure you can understand.The winner of each Nextel Cup race receives 180 points. The runner-up scores 170. From there, the point total declines in five-point increments for Nos. 2-6; points drop four points per driver for Nos. 7-11; and three-point increments separate drivers' points for finishers 12th place and lower.\n\nIn addition to the points allocated, any driver who leads a lap receives five bonus points. The driver who leads the most laps receives an additional five bonus points.\nIn Nextel Cup racing, following the 26th race of the season, all drivers in the top 10 -- and any others within 400 points of the leader -- earn a berth in the Chase for the Nextel Cup.\n\nAll drivers in the Chase will have their point totals adjusted. The first-place driver in the standings begins the Chase with 5,050 points; the second-place driver will start with 5,045, etc. Incremental five-point drops will continue through 10th place (5,005 points).\n\nIf more than 10 drivers qualify for the Chase, the additional drivers will have their points reset at 5,005.\n\n• Owners are rewarded in the points race in much the same fashion but, unlike drivers, they earn points for merely attempting to make a race. If an owner shows up with two drivers and one fails to qualify, the owner still receives points for the non-qualifying effort.\n\nThrough the first five races of the season, the top 35 in owners' points from the previous season are guaranteed a starting spot in the race. Beginning with the sixth race, the top 35 in current owners' points are guaranteed a spot.\n\nThe fastest non-qualifier on race day earns 31 points for his owner, three down from the 43rd-place points. The scale continues downward for all non-qualifiers, with the lowest possible point awarded being one.\n\n• Manufacturers have a points race of their own. The car maker who has a driver take first place in a race earns nine points for that race. Second-best performance by a manufacturer gets six points, third place earns four points and fourth place, three points\nRace Points System \nFinish Points   Finish Points",Sports,1.414673207388097e-05

777,"Title: are libra and cancer signs compatible at all? (RANDOM)?, Content: ahh sorry this is really random haha!, Answer: Cancer and Libra\n\nWhen Cancer and Libra make a love match, they give to one another important things that each lacks. Both Signs seek a secure, assured relationship and will enjoy their shared appreciation for beauty and luxury -- especially when it comes to their domestic environment. These two can blend their energies harmoniously if they choose to work toward a common goal. Though this pairing may progress more slowly than some others, and at first they may fear that they have little else in common than their mutual needs for companionship and love of beauty. However, the more they get to know one another, the better each individual in this Cancer-Libra love match will recognize and respect positive qualities in the other. \n\nNeither Cancer nor Libra shy away from combining the powers of their emotion and their intellect, and both enjoy the occasional teary opera or sentimental heirloom. Expression of sentiment and happiness are important to both Signs, and Cancer and Libra can complement one another in many ways. Cancer appreciates Libra's charm and tact, and Libra's calm, cool diplomacy skills can tame even the wildest pouting fit a Cancer can muster up. Also, Libra, lover of aesthetic beauty and harmony, will appreciate their Cancer mate's nurturing instinct for a comfortable home and the security that comes with it. Libra can offer the sometimes emotionally impetuous Cancer some perspective on situations. Cancer needs to see the different sides of an issue, or this Crab may be prone to making decisions without knowing all the facts. Conversely, Cancer can help Libra cure their notorious indecision. \n\nThe Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and the Planet Venus (Love) rules Libra. These planetary partners share a love of home, family and romance. While Libra is known for its balancing nature (the Balance is Libra's symbol, after all!), these love partners share nurturing personalities and desire harmony over conflict. More than any other match-up of Signs, this astrological pair brings a warmth and sense of stability to those around them. Despite all the harmony and homey happiness, though, Librans, whose life approach is based on intellect, can be a bit snobbish and superior, and Cancer, who looks at life through emotional lenses, still has those easily bruised feelings to contend with.",Entertainment & Music,0.27639655242096783

She was officially sworn in at MEPS the following march, the very day of her 18th birthday. We met a few days after she was sworn in. We married in July she is in Basic training now. She was so scared when she left, she is sacred now, she never wanted to go, she was just afraid to say no to her Dad. Her dream is to be a veterinarian, but her Dad got her signed up as an Infantry Supply clerk. Is there anyway to save her from this nightmare. Is there anyway to get her discarged?, Answer: She should stay in.  Basic will probably be the hardest thing she'll have to do.  After she gets out, she can go anywhere as a supply clerk.  Probably won't go to a combat area unless she requests it.\nSo she gets stationed somewhere states side.  It's like a 9-5 job most of the time.  She come in, do her job, and go home.  She'll get housing, so you can join her.\nIt'll pay for her school to be a veterinarian.  Hell, she can go to some night classes and get all the prerequisites outta the way before she gets out.\nHowever, if she really wants out and she is in basic...all she has to do is ask.  They will try to talk her out of it.  Probably bad mouth her.  Call her names.  Etc.  But they will give her a general discharge..or a less than honorable discharge I think they called it.\nWe had someone go awol while I was in basic and they just mailed him his less than honorable.  They don't want to spend too much money on someone and just have them leave.  They may sound tough on her...but they will let her leave if she wants.  Have her talk to the military pastor/preacher.

George Pataki and Maryland Gov.

799,"Title: what is french kissing?Is it some where near the legs?why is it so different.?, Content: can men n women both do it., Answer: A French kiss is a romantic or sexual kiss in which one participant's tongue touches the other's tongue (or lips), and usually enters their mouth. Also known as a tongue Kiss, or Deep Kiss.\n\nWhile family members may sometimes kiss on the lips, a tongue kiss almost always indicates a romantic or sexual relationship. French kissing stimulates the lips, tongue and mouth, which are all areas very sensitive to touch. It is considered by many to be both very pleasurable and highly intimate. Unlike other forms of ""casual"" kissing (such as brief kisses of greeting or friendship), episodes of French kissing will often be prolonged, intense, and passionate. It may signal the beginning of a period of ""making out"" or sex. Because of the intimacy associated with it, in many regions of the world tongue kissing in public is not acceptable to most, particularly in the case of extended duration. See: public display of affection.\n\nIn a tongue kiss participants may exchange saliva, which would often be considered disgusting in other contexts, but which may add to the passion and excitement of the sexual kiss. Although most sexually-transmitted diseases are not transmitted by kissing, the exchange of saliva in a French kiss may increase the chances of catching an orally transmitted disease. Infectious Mononucleosis (American: Mononucleosis or, colloquially, ""mono""; European: Glandular Fever), a disease spread through saliva, is often colloquially referred to as ""the kissing disease.""",Society & Culture,0.01570654139660753

Daniel Drew gained Wall Street renowned for issuing stock in Erie Railroad.  He coined the term ""watered stock"" after his previous experience of driving cattle to the market and right before placing them for sale would not give them anything to drink for 3 days and then let them drink their fill just prior to weighing them for market.  He used the same technique with Erie Railroad stock, printing up and issuing stock and throwing it on the market for investors to snap up. The technique has not been lost to Wall Street even though Daniel performed his feats during the years 1866-1867.  Today there are many stocks traded on the stock exchanges where there are virtually no net assets, but yet the stocks trade at $5, $10, even $50 a share.",Business & Finance,6.948172072109499e-08

As the car approached the young man on the road he just barely put out his left thumb so as to indicate he needed a lift but trying to maintain some body heat.\n\nAs the driver passed by the young  man something inside him told him to stop.  He had never before stopped to pick up anyone like this before.  He brought his car to a stop about a quarter mile down the road from the young man.  As he turned to look back through the rear windshield he could see the young man running down the road toward his car.  Soon the young man was standing at the passenger door looking in the through the window the driver had lowered.  \n\n“I sure could use a lift,” said the young man.  The driver asked,  “which way do you need to go?”  The young man replied, “I need to go east.  Are you going that way?”  The driver hesitated for just a moment and then said, “Yeah.  I’m going east.  Get in.”\n\nThe young man almost jumped into the car.  His hair was covered in ice and with the warmth of the car it began to melt and drip from his hair.  As the driver pulled onto the road heading back to the highway he asked the young man, “where do you need to go?”  He replied, “I’m trying to get to my dad’s house in Virginia”.  The driver said, “That’s a long way to hitch hike don’t you think?  Why didn’t you call you dad and get some help getting back home?”\n\nThe young man replied, “ I haven’t talked to my dad in 5 years.  I left home on bad terms with him.  I was doing some things I new I shouldn’t do and dad didn’t approve.  So I left and said I’m never coming back.  Now I’ve lost my job.  I’ve lost my girl friend.  I have no money, no friends, and no place to live.  I don’t have anything left and nowhere to go.  I was afraid to call him. What if he said no I can’t come home?  Then what would I do?  Where would I go?  I thought if I can just make it back home maybe I can walk up and knock on his door.  Tell him how sorry I am.  Maybe he would let me come home.”\n\nThe driver pulled his car onto the interstate and headed east retracing the path from which he had just come.  The two continued to talk about what had happened in the young man’s life.  \n\nAs they drove and talked they soon came to a large city.  The driver without saying why began following the signs that showed the way to the airport.  The young man asked, “Where are we going.”  The driver responded, “I’m going to pay for a ticket for you to fly home.  You need to be with your dad.”  The two went into the airport together where the driver bought the ticket.  He handed it to the young man and said, “you’d better hurry you’re going to miss your flight.”  The young man hugged the driver and then with tears in his eyes he said, “You know, you didn’t have to do this, did you?”  \n\nThe driver paused for just a moment and looking back into the young man’s eyes responded, “ Yeah, I think I did.”\n\nI then found myself looking up a the crucified Jesus hanging on the cross looking down into my eyes.  I looked up at him acknowledging what He had done for me and with tears in my eyes I said, “You know, You didn’t have to do this, did You?”   \n\nJ, Answer: Very nice dream.  Thanks for posting it.  The representation in the dream is very good.  We the human family through rebellion and disobedience left our Heavenly Father, just like the boy in this dream left his father.  We then often find ourselves in dire situations, and want our Heavenly Father to forgive us and help us just like this boy did.  Jesus then, just like the kind man in this dream, paid the price and ticket to made possible for us to be forgiven and get back to our Father. \n\n Father forgive us and teach us that truth that sets us free (John 8:32).",Society & Culture,0.12584363366351933

English has this role to some extent, but the trouble is that it is quite a difficult language to learn to speak well.  It is also the first language of many nations and so that puts those who don't speak it as a first language at a disadvantage.

985,"Title: Do u know info about beethoven?, Content: I'm doin a music history project. Please help, Answer: Beethoven, Ludwig van \n \n \n (lŭd´wĭg văn bā´tōvn, Ger. lt´vĭkh fän bāt´hōfn) , 1770—1827, German composer. He is universally recognized as one of the greatest composers of the Western European music tradition. Beethoven's work crowned the classical period and also effectively initiated the romantic era in music. He is one of the few artists who genuinely may be considered revolutionary.\n\nLife\n\nBorn in Bonn, Beethoven showed remarkable talent at an early age. His father, a court musician, subjected him to a brutal regimen, hoping to exploit him as a child prodigy. While this plan did not succeed, young Beethoven's gifts were recognized and nurtured by his teachers and by members of the local aristocracy. In 1787 Beethoven first visited Vienna, at that time the center of the music world. There he performed for Mozart, whom he greatly impressed.\n\nIn 1792 Haydn invited him to become his student, and Beethoven returned to Vienna, where he was to remain permanently. However, Beethoven's unorthodox musical ideas offended the old master, and the lessons were terminated. Beethoven studied with several other eminent teachers, including Antonio Salieri, but was developing according to his own singular genius and could no longer profit greatly from instruction.\n\nBoth his breathtaking piano virtuosity and his remarkable compositions won Beethoven favor among the enlightened aristocracy congregated at Vienna, and he enjoyed their generous support throughout his life. They were tolerant, too, of his notoriously boorish manners, careless appearance, and towering rages. His work itself was widely accepted, if controversial, and from the end of the 1790s Beethoven was not dependent on patronage for his income.\n\nThe year 1801 marked the onset of Beethoven's tragic affliction, his deafness, which became progressively worse and, by 1817, total. Public performance eventually became impossible; but his creative work was not restricted. Beethoven never married; however, he was stormily in and out of love all his life, always with women unattainable because of marriage or station. His personal life was further complicated when he was made the guardian of his nephew Karl, who caused him much anxiety and grief but to whom he nevertheless remained fondly attached. Beethoven died, after a long illness, in the midst of a fierce thunderstorm, and legend has it that the dying man shook his fist in defiance of the heavens.\n\nCompositions\n\nBy the 19th cent., Beethoven's work could already be divided into three fairly distinct periods. The works of the first period include the First (1800) and Second (1802) Symphonies; the first three piano concertos (1795—1800); the first group of string quartets (1800); and a number of piano sonatas, among them the Pathétique (1798) and the Moonlight Sonata (1801). Although the compositions of the first period have Beethoven's unmistakable breadth and vitality, they are dominated by the tradition of Haydn and Mozart.\n\nBeginning about 1802, Beethoven's work took on new dimensions. The premiere in 1805 of the massive Third Symphony, known as the Eroica (composed 1803—4), was a landmark in cultural history. It signaled a definitive break with the past and the birth of a new era. The length, structure, harmonies, and orchestration of the Eroica all broke the formal conventions of classical music; unprecedented too was its intention–to celebrate human freedom and nobility. The symphony was originally dedicated to Napoleon, who at first symbolized to Beethoven the spirit of the French Revolution and the liberation of mankind; however, when Napoleon proclaimed himself emperor, the disillusioned composer renamed his work the ""Heroic Symphony to celebrate the memory of a great man."" \n\nThe works of Beethoven's middle period, his most productive, include the Piano Concertos No. 4 (1806) and No. 5 (Emperor Concerto, 1809); the Razumovsky Quartets (1806); ",Business & Finance,0.02098511482269089
