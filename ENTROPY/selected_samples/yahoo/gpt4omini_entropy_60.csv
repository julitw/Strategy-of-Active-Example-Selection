Am I the only American answering this question??? I was born here and I have lived here my whole life and I ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT have to learn another language to communicate with people in MY OWN COUNTRY! If I moved to India or S. America or Mexico or whatever I would not expect people to learn English so I would feel at home and comfortable! I would not move there until I knew at least the minimum appropriate language to speak to the people of that land with respect. If you go to another country at least have respect enough for the people of that land to learn thier language...and maybe even a bit about thier history. I understand that people come here to get away from poverty and find a better life, I don't disagree with the USA giving that to them but as far as not being able to afford to learn English...that's a crock! It's spoken everday all day everywhere you go! Your kids go to school and learn and are taught in English.....learn from them! To say that someone is unqualified for a job because they only speak the language of the country in which they live speaks that is the dumbest and stuck - up thing I have ever heard!! Just like Gearge Carlin says...""If you are going to take my order of french fries and a double cheeseburger, do it in English"" PERIOD! I am living proof of respect for people in those countries...just so you know I am not talking ""out of the side of my neck"" I was actually thinking about moving to Italy and in the process of researching that option I also looked up a few local places where I could take basic Italian. It's just respect for the country in which you live to learn the language....not ask the country to learn yours!!\n\n\nP.S.......blondie....a mispell does not mean that someone does not know english...and stereotyping is probably not in your best interest...I mean you are a blonde!!",Politics & Government

Boys don't have experience. A woman doesn't want a boy fumbling around down there with no idea of what or how.\n\nBesides no woman likes a whore. Most men I would suspect don't have much use for them either.\n\nThe only ones who would use a whore is someone in a bad, sexless marriage, a drunk looking to ""get off"", and a young man who wishes to gain experience but, can't seem to win a girl's heart, mind or body.\n\nYou may consider it a double standard but, put in that situation,  what would you prefer?
