"Title: why did i get bagged?, Content: so i am sitting around work today because i had to work some overtime (on test scripts) and no one is in the office and i'm getting as bored as a lion in the gymnasium with no children to munch on.  so i wheel around the room with the linoleum floor on one of the office chairs and i'm getting pretty excited, and i'm going pretty fast round and round.  but then i realize i am not going as fast as an antelope being chased by a lion so i wonder what can make me go even faster and faster.  i think pretty hard about this problem, then i promptly unhinge a fire extinguisher from its holder, take my seat on my speedy chair, place the extinguisher in my crotch with the nozzle pointed away from me and i pull the pin very abruptly.  out of nowhere i am jettisoned towarded the back of the room and i knock over various flat screen monitors, injuring my head, and breaking some monitors (not all).  i guess my boss was around and i didn't know, and he comes in and drops me a pink slip.  do i sue?, Answer: I think that you could probably find a way to blame it on him and sue him.

"Title: someone stole a amp and 2 speakers what do you think he shold did kick their butts or let the police take care, Content: of it i told him to let the police handle it, Answer: File a claim with the police.  File a claim with your insurance company.  Neither one will result in getting the merchandise back or any money, but it will establish a record of the crime.  This will help if you catch the same people in the act next time.\n\nAnother precaution you can take (besides locking up the car and house securely and/or with an alarm) is to engrave a code number on your stuff, and write down the code number on a separate piece of paper that you put in safe-keeping.  Then if you know who took the stuff, the police can check for the code number you provide them, and that will be enough evidence for them to reclaim the property and charge the criminals.\n\nGood luck!",Business & Finance

"Title: I am a American woman in love with Indian man. What is the easiest way to get him to America?, Content: , Answer: First question to you is, have you met this man in person and spent a significant amount of time with him in person?  and I mean face to face, not over the phone or webcams, etc.  If not, you want to do this first, and you might want to first visit his country if you have not done so, then next, bring him over on a tourist visa to visit you.  Internet relationships can be a great start, but the real proof is face to face, day to day.\n\nAlso, because these are very different cultures, do a lot of research on the Indian culture, so that you are well-informed.  Love does not conquer all, you need to be ready to deal with the obstacles and difficulties, and knowing what they might be will be most helpful to you.\n\nMake sure that he is not just wanting to find a way to the U.S.  A lot of Indians want to move to Canada or the U.S., and some will use marriage if they have to, to accomplish this.  You would rather be aware of this now, than later.\n\nWhen you are ready to bring him over permanently, if that is your decision, then you will want to go to the Immigration website and read through the material and fill out the application forms to go through the process.

"Title: who leads a happier life the illegal or the anti?, Content: i say the illegal, antis sound uptight and hateful, Answer: Generally speaking, a person who devotes time and energy to a cause which demeans the persona of another human being different than themselves suffers from  at the least  what is termed in professional psychiatry jargon, ""Personality Disorder"" syndrome. This condition can lead to further  serious emotional problems when it is nourished by  an external reinforcement mechanisms such as the participation  in  a larger group  holding similar ideas. As an example, the evident characteristics displayed during  the  mass rallies held by Isalmists as they scream their hatred for the Americans, are  manifestations of this type of psychological degeneration. Similar behavior can be witnessed in  a group closer to us, and that would be   the minutemen who each has internalized this victimized objectification of the 'Mexican"" illegal. In this case you also have misplaced blame for whatever personal failures or fears they suppress or deny. The leaders of such groups can also be further classified into Messianic , Grandiose personality, sociopaths, whether it is Hitler or the local head of the KKK you are talking about..\nTherefore this would explain the depressive characteristics of the typical anti-undocumented.
