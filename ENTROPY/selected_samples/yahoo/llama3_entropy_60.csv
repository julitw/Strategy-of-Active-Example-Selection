"Title: why did i get bagged?, Content: so i am sitting around work today because i had to work some overtime (on test scripts) and no one is in the office and i'm getting as bored as a lion in the gymnasium with no children to munch on.  so i wheel around the room with the linoleum floor on one of the office chairs and i'm getting pretty excited, and i'm going pretty fast round and round.  but then i realize i am not going as fast as an antelope being chased by a lion so i wonder what can make me go even faster and faster.  i think pretty hard about this problem, then i promptly unhinge a fire extinguisher from its holder, take my seat on my speedy chair, place the extinguisher in my crotch with the nozzle pointed away from me and i pull the pin very abruptly.  out of nowhere i am jettisoned towarded the back of the room and i knock over various flat screen monitors, injuring my head, and breaking some monitors (not all).  i guess my boss was around and i didn't know, and he comes in and drops me a pink slip.  do i sue?, Answer: I think that you could probably find a way to blame it on him and sue him.

It's a force of nature.\n\nAs far as the damage, several things could have been done. For starters, smarter costal management would have prevented the dredging of shipping lanes into New Orleans which provided a clear path for flood waters to sweep into the city. Furthermore, had they reinforced the levies in a timely manner, they would have been able to withstand the flooding and protect the city.\n\nHaving failed that, there should have been much better organization to evacuate and provide for the residents. Immediately following the disaster, there was utter chaos. There was a lot being offered but no guidance as to where that aide would be beneficial.",Education & Reference

I'd say if you look to spend $25 to $30 for scope and rings for your Marlin, you'll be shooting inside the ""C"" on a Coca-cola can all day. \n\nYou can get one of the really cheap Tasco or no-name rimfire scopes with .22 rings for like $6 at Wal-Mart or any sporting goods chain, but I'd advise spending a little more for better quality. \n\nHere's a sweet one by Bushnell for $36 that will be all you ever want:\n\nhttp://www.cheaperthandirt.com/17388-15815-1541.html\n\nOn my rimfires, I like the old steel Weaver rimfire scopes that they don't make anymore but that you can find at gun shows and on Ebay sometimes.

This will help if you catch the same people in the act next time.\n\nAnother precaution you can take (besides locking up the car and house securely and/or with an alarm) is to engrave a code number on your stuff, and write down the code number on a separate piece of paper that you put in safe-keeping.  Then if you know who took the stuff, the police can check for the code number you provide them, and that will be enough evidence for them to reclaim the property and charge the criminals.\n\nGood luck!",Business & Finance

If you are talking about your allowance then you should be more concerned with helping out and doing your part than worrying about 83 cents. My guess is your parents want you to help out around the house to learn the value of work.\n\nPersonally, if a child of mine counted every penny and insisted on 83 cents for unloading the dishwasher they would find themselves doing a lot of unpaid chores for quite a while.\n\nIf on the other hand, you are talking about pay for hire like a part time job, labor laws vary state by state.

"Title: How can you get out of the army?, Content: Before I met my wife (when she was 17) her Ex-Navy father got mad at her and drove her down to the army recruiting station and forced her to enlist. She was officially sworn in at MEPS the following march, the very day of her 18th birthday. We met a few days after she was sworn in. We married in July she is in Basic training now. She was so scared when she left, she is sacred now, she never wanted to go, she was just afraid to say no to her Dad. Her dream is to be a veterinarian, but her Dad got her signed up as an Infantry Supply clerk. Is there anyway to save her from this nightmare. Is there anyway to get her discarged?, Answer: She should stay in.  Basic will probably be the hardest thing she'll have to do.  After she gets out, she can go anywhere as a supply clerk.  Probably won't go to a combat area unless she requests it.\nSo she gets stationed somewhere states side.  It's like a 9-5 job most of the time.  She come in, do her job, and go home.  She'll get housing, so you can join her.\nIt'll pay for her school to be a veterinarian.  Hell, she can go to some night classes and get all the prerequisites outta the way before she gets out.\nHowever, if she really wants out and she is in basic...all she has to do is ask.  They will try to talk her out of it.  Probably bad mouth her.  Call her names.  Etc.  But they will give her a general discharge..or a less than honorable discharge I think they called it.\nWe had someone go awol while I was in basic and they just mailed him his less than honorable.  They don't want to spend too much money on someone and just have them leave.  They may sound tough on her...but they will let her leave if she wants.  Have her talk to the military pastor/preacher.  He can help her. \nOn that note...make sure she wants to and she's not just echoing what you want...this less than honorable discharge will follow her everywhere.",Politics & Government
