Goodbye 2019. May you rot in hell. : ,not depression
"Meds check? : My doctor changed my medication to panazep 12.5 and etizolam. Today's the first day day I took this combo. Is this supposed to make me feel so drowsy through the day always or is it just because this is new?
Note- medication for anxiety, depression and insomnia. I will be interviewing shortly for jobs.",severe

"Trying alcohol for first time on Wellbutrin? : Honestly, I’m really sick of not being able to try alcohol. I want to have a drink or two, but I’m scared of what might happen. I have a group of friends that obviously will be looking after me but still. I’m on 300 mg a day. And I really don’t plan on drinking weekly or anything maybe a drink or two once a month. Any word of advice?",severe

"Dental Care Tips? : So, I'm narcoleptic and depressed. These are my two biggest disorders so I have literally no energy to take care of myself most days. My teeth are kinda neglected at the moment but I am fortunate enough to have regular dental cleanings every six months like they recommend, but that's not enough in between appointments. I'm primarily concerned about my gum health and I believe my dentist is as well.

Basically all I'm asking is how can I take extra care to make sure my teeth don't fall out when I'm thirty...? Anything and everything is appreciated.",moderate

Anyone has tips?",not depression
"My heart aches but i cant break : Recently my relationship ended, not only did i lose my boyfriend i lost my best friend.  Im so attached to him, we lived together for at least 6 months. Ive been struggling with depression since. I tend to really be influenced by those i date if the relationship lasts over 7months. Ive also had a drinking problem that i just now got a grip on (before the breakup). What are proper coping mechanisms? What do nonalcoholics even do? I know i cant binge drink, &amp; i know i cant let myself sink into deep depression bc that will result in a breakdown which leads to binge drinking. The nights have become the loneliest bc during the day i must act like everything is ok. I dont want people to worry abt me so i just stay in. I dont have any energy to go outside &amp; be around multiple people. I wake up wanting to roll back &amp; go to sleep bt when it gets to 12 pm i know i cant &amp; then getting told i have to actually do things is the most off putting thing to hear first thing in the morning like give me time to breathe. I looked into coping mechanisms bc i dont want to burry the event &amp;not go thru this properly. Ive been drinking water &amp; trying to eat a little bc i know thats what i must do regardless if i want to or even care to. See self care is the hardest part bc i could care less. But today i woke up feeling ok. &amp;thats a big accomplishment for me. Little steps to recovery. Ive been watching subbed anime to have something to focus on. I know in time it will get better, i just have to hold on",moderate

"I ruined NYE for my GF : I went to a party with my GF that I was really excited to go to earlier. I had looked forward to this party and night for about a week now. But at the party, my first time going to a NYE party, I just got depressed and ruined it for her. She was having so much fun with her other friends and I wasn't doing anything. After we got all got tired she tried to comfort me and help me feel better, but I already knew I ruined it for her. I don't understand why I had to do this, and hate myself so much for ruining such a good night for her.",moderate

"How long do Mirtazapine side effects last? : [Throwaway account because my gf follows me]
My partner has just come off 2 months of 30mg mirtazapine for depression and anxiety, due to it not really helping, and because of the frustrating (mainly sexual) side effects (the usual, but far worse than other meds) that appeared as soon as she started taking it. 
This has obviously sucked for both of us, our sex life is nonexistent recently. Luckily we’re very open when it comes to things like this, so it didn’t cause any tension or frustration. 
I’m on sertraline and have been on other antidepressants, so I can empathise with what she’s feeling, but I’ve never been on mirtazapine, so my question to anyone with experience with this medication is:
Assuming you experienced similar problems, how long did it take for your sex drive to return, and were there any long term issues?
Thanks in advance",severe
"i cant do this anymore, ending it all : im a guy (16) i have had a raised mole above my lip for 15 years

"I don’t know what to do... : My girlfriend is having a really hard time right now... We’re both in college (same class too) and have been together for over a year now... She’s really having trouble here in college, she’s so smart but whenever she does really bad on something she starts breaking down and pushes me away... (Ex. Trying to hug her, she says “No this is all my fault stop trying to make me feel better”, or “Don’t look at me”...) I have depression so it really hurts, but I know she’s really having a hard time... I keep having breakdowns myself because I have a much easier major and I feel like I’m so useless because I can’t help her... But I want to worry about her, because I’m worried she’s coming down a path just like me... I love her to death but I don’t know what to do... And if I point her out to getting some help, she says “I can’t afford it” or “I don’t have enough time”... Whether it’s for getting some tutoring or even counseling... And I’m worried she might not understand that I can tell she needs help but because of how her family raised her (feelings aren’t important/can’t afford to get you help/you have no right to feel that way/you’re a disappointment/you’ll never succeed doing it your way) she doesn’t find it important... I’m so stuck and I don’t want something to happen to her... She’s clearly taking all of this very hard... Sorry I’ve been ranting a lot but... it really hurts me to see her this way and I can tell she might be going down a path similar to mine... And I want to help her before she gets there... I just don’t know how...",not depression

"Waiting for my mind to have a breakdown once the “New Year” feeling isn’t there anymore : I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m a little bit worried that I’ll go back to being depressed in a few days time or something. Last year, I tried not to have any breakdowns for the start of 2019. A mere 10 days later, I broke down crying. I wasn’t the same for that entire year. Up until December, where I was ok that month. Now I just wait... it’s a weird way to act and feel, but it feels a bit normal.",moderate
"Feel so alone : Even though I got invited to a party last night, I still feel so alone. I know I’m probably not gonna get invited to another party or meetup for at least 6 months, and on top of this I get to see everyone else having fun at parties on social media I wasn’t invited to during these six months. Everyone constantly blows me off, even when I try my hardest.",moderate
"Struggling : Hey everyone.

It's the New Year, and like a lot of people around here I'm really struggling. If everything goes well, I'll have 3 years sober. I guess without the alcohol and the drugs I'm just left with myself, and that is the problem.

Without the drugs and alcohol I just cannot seem to make the slightest effort to make meaningful relationships with people. I still go to meetings but even in a room full of people I can feel so alone. I don't have friends, no relationships the past few years, and now I guess I've isolated myself so much that I just don't know how to talk to people. I drive them away, and eventually, the contact will stop altogether. I don't know how I'll go through this year. I just hope I can make it to the three years in March. 

Thanks for reading. I don't expect people to really care, but I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

I hope everyone else has a better New Year than I did.",moderate

Anyone else having the weirdest alternatives to suicide? : [removed],moderate
"Meaningless.. : I really don’t wanna put extra negative thoughts in others heads but i just feel really down on the realisation that a human life is meaningless..

I mean, i used to believe in destiny, fate and all that stuff and to this day I still believe that the human mind is capable of more than we are lead to believe (harder to back it with action whilst living with mental illness). But so many things that are wrong with this world and so many things happening that just make me feel so insignificant..

What was that starved to death child in Africa’s destiny? What was that baby that died at births destiny? What was the 1345th person out of 5000 that commit suicide in the UK every years destiny?... 

I watched this video on Youtube the other day about 5 teens getting sentenced to jail for murder. They were throwing large stones off a bridge onto a motorway and one of them killed a father of 3 on his way home from work... And i seen a comment on it that said “Imagine living your whole life, having kids with your wife only to be killed on your way home from work by some stupid teens”.... And fuck that hit hard.. That guy is now dead. That guy that contributed more to society and probably more for his kids then I’ve done in my life and his existence was just wiped out. Some kids just doing stupid kid stuff and shot that man out of existence. Now what the fuck was his destiny??.. Where was the “everything falls into place at the right time” meaning in his fucking story....
It really makes me think on how nothing actually really fucking matters. We live in a much better society then the people 1000 years ago and can you imagine the suicide rate then? And how many of those people do you have the faintest clue about that existed..

We like to fill our heads with bullshit on how we are the centre of the Universe and all that shit but you really think god cares about the 1 of his infinite living creations.. We are the most intelligent species on our planet but our lives hold as much significance as that ant you accidentally stepped on on your way to work. Or that spider you killed because you didn’t like the way it looked. Or that flower you picked that eventually withered and died..

If there is any meaning to our very very very short time we spend being sentient. It is what we give it.. And I can’t see anything more meaningful than trying your best to embody good in this cruel world.. This world suffers so much and there’s nothing that should make you feel more proud of your existence than doing what is right.. You have to look out for yourself and your own well-being but give some of what you have spare to others..
This world needs kindness and compassion and generosity more than ever.. We as humans have the most tainted past. But strive to be the difference..

Give your spare change to that homeless man. Let someone infront of you in queue. Give up your seat for someone standing on public transport. Stand in protest against climate change, corrupt governments, unjustified wars, terrorism, poverty, homelessness, Etc.. All the little things create just that little bit extra kindness in the world.. 

All of you that are on this board know pain. Know suffering. Know what it is like to fester in negativity..
Don’t be a multiplier of this pain.. Be an example of the society that you wished you lived in.. You may not contribute as much as you want towards society. But you gave abit of whatever light you have left to someone else. And made there light just abit brighter. In that moment you were the god that gifted someone else. Wether that be stopping a kid from being bullied or sparing the life of that spider.. At that moment you were in charge of making a difference to someones life. And you gave them happiness. And that gives your life meaning...",moderate

"The trials : Hey. New to this community. But not really new to depression. I have been medicated a while and recently made the choice to try and handle life myself. 

Dont get me wrong. Im in a great place in life right now. I have an amazing boyfriend. My job is.... relatively great. I cant complain.

The thing is, though... my demons still haunt me. I have a not-so-great family. That is my biggest hill to climb and always has been. I hate getting like this because I get so irritable and snap at my boyfriend. Any little thing triggers me and turns me into this hateful person. Don’t get me wrong, I’m hurting. Im not a bad person but its easier to destroy relationships than build them, right? I think thats a common in this community. 

My other biggest vice is dependency. Right now the withdrawals from my medication are bringing me down, even though weed and nicotine help. Unfortunately, weed is hard to come by in my situation and the nicotine helps until I overdue it and feel terrible. Then when I run out of weed its like nothing is good and I hate everything. Maybe its just the dependency, and I know some of you may feel that drugs are terrible, but it helps. Because in this situation even a moment of relief is worth it, right? Sadly, I know sedation is only a temporary (and non-sustainable) solution. But it helps, right? 

I like smoking because it takes a whole cloud of thoughts, worries, and troubles to a minimum. It takes all the extra stuff away and at that point, its just me. 

I was the, hands down, happiest in my life when I was physically fit. I was serious about fitness and eating right at one time and thats something I want to get back from. But how do you make that step? I weigh the most I ever have, and also feel the worst. I know the solution, but actually doing it is so hard. Its so hard to focus on something when you are wearing a mask. Constantly focusing on keeping thoughts at bay is exhausting and all that I want to do is relax. 

Im sorry for the read. I know my first post is just a jumbled rant, but I wanted to give this community a try. Because even though I am terrible about giving the community I have IRL a chance, community is all we have, right? 

Best Wishes,
Elijah.",moderate

"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

"Severe depression on weekends but not during week, at wit's end? Stealing all my joy. : Hi all.
I'm 26, have a diagnosed mental disorder (I feel uncomfortable disclosing) and have been on medication for many years (mood stabilizers). I do not struggle with depression **in general** despite a very dysfunctional family that causes 99% of my stress. I cope very well in day to day life, even through the 3 weeks where my dad was close to dying in hospital this year. I have a very positive outlook and maintain a normal job which I am very successful at. I am also in a wonderful romantic relationship for 2 years and have a good friendship circle. All the boxes are ticked. 
But this is where things go wrong. On a weekend I find myself in such a black hole and specifically on Sundays. I can barely move on a Sunday. Yesterday I spent the entire day in a fog, I was unpleasant to be around, I could barely talk to my partner and I honestly just wanted to sleep. This is rinse and repeat every week for as long as I can remember. Now I know what you're thinking, is it my job? I can honestly say that is impossible because I am very happy at my job, it virtually has no stress components to me and during the week I am in SUCH a good, happy, upbeat positive mood. I don't dread going to work.  I don't worry about work ever. I leave work and don't think about it again or  have to.
But bloody hell, Saturday rolls by and I often like death. Sunday comes and I am suicidal all over again.  I know Sunday blues is a thing and it has crossed my mind but I don't know how to cope or change this? I try and make plans for Sundays but no matter what I do, I feel exhausted, tired, drained, sad, depressed. I can have the best day planned will all my favorite things and still feel like crap. It sometimes is the same on a Saturday too. I wake up excited for the weekend and it is just... shit. But then during the week I'm so happy?
It's starting to make me act very irritated towards my partner and I cannot figure out how to change this. I'm in good shape. I exercise a lot. But this fog... it comes on a weekend and goes away Monday.",not depression
