"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even. Whatever the case set a task for yourself you kind of feel accomplished in a way. I just kind of wanted to put my thoughts out there venting also helps obviously lol",moderate

"Is escapism a good or a bad thing to you? : I’m sure I’m not the only one that spends a lot of time watching tv/videos, gaming, reading books etc. I’ve heard some say time spent content is not time wasted, and they like to experience things through these mediums.

"You don't know what to do? : I see all the poor, depressed old people walking around who don't know what to do with their lives, complain about politics,  dissatisfied with their current lives and bad decisions they took.  I would like to have a house close to the sea in a warm place for example, a lot of money, family, children, live in a country and have a job that I like and hobbies i love when I am 70. The more you focus on it, the faster you'll be there and live it and don't waste your time and energy on nonsense that won't take you anywhere. I have already reached 60%-70% and i'm 40. I think at 50 I will archive all of them. When we have a goal, our thoughts and decisions are easier and cleaner. If everyone would do it, we would have happier faces around us. 

You don't know what to do?  then look at you at 70 and you will know the answer. Or 60, 50 whatever.

"Embrace yourself❤️ : It’s important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don’t lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can’t exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.

So don’t fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I’ve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that’s ok, because it doesn’t matter, nothing matters after all. Don’t take life too serious, it’s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it’s okay, because you’re being loved.

"Should I avoid dating with my current position in life? : I’m 21, taking a year off from school. I work part time at a Walmart, but I don’t have a car and I’m going paycheck to paycheck. I live with my best friend at his mom’s house. I pay rent, but my bedroom acts as our living room so not a whole lot of privacy. I have pretty poor social skills and have zero luck with women anyways. I also have clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD and dissociation, all of which I’ve dealt with since I was a small child. I was in therapy all throughout my childhood and have gotten significantly better at coping with it, though atm I’m too broke to afford health insurance, so now therapy or meds because I definitely can’t afford out of pocket even with a sliding scale. I am always trying to improve myself, though, I’m not the type to let mental illness be an excuse to let my symptoms run rampant, and I don’t let it affect my personal relationships as much as I can.
