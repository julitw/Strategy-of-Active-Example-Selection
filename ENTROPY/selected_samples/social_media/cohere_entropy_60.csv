Goodbye (Hopefully) to the pain of the last decade : [removed],not depression
"I said I wanted to be alive for 2020 : It’s stupid. it’s so small. my mom won’t even remember it but I will. she asked how my NYE was and if I was still alive after the partying. Without thinking, I said yes, and that intended to be for all of 2020 

my mother, who has taken me to the hospital 5 times for suicide attempts started bawling. She said that was the first time in 10 entire ass years that I said i wanted and intended to be alive. 

I’m crying. It’s sad. It’s kinda beautiful. It’s mostly sad. I love you mom",moderate

"Emotional Depression vs Chemical Depression &amp; how the mind reacts : Many of you probably know this but just in case...
If you have emotional depression, it's because something bad happened recently.  You lost your job and bills are piling up, your best friend died, you lost a child, whatever.  It's an emotional response to a life event.  Things suck right now, but they can and will get better because of time.  You aren't the first person to be in this situation, you won't be the last person. Hang in there, get what help you can.
If you have chemical depression, it's because your body isn't making the right amount of the right chemical, or it's going through the right chemical but too quickly, etc.  This is like having diabetes. It's not caused by an event, it's not a reaction to something which has happened or is likely to happen. It's a medical condition that you need medicine to control.  Yes, some people can achieve help with diet changes, some people can exercise their way out, but in all cases it's still a bio-chemical problem.
Talk therapy is not going to fix chemical depression.  Changing jobs is not going to fix chemical depression.  Having kids is not going to fix chemical depression.
Now, here's the kicker -- your brain is fucking stupid. It does not control the body, it justifies the body. If you eat a pizza and then later feel sick, your brain decides it was the pizza.  It may be that you have the flu and the pizza has nothing to do with it, but your brain is looking for cause and effect, so until it gets convinced otherwise, you hate pizza.
Another example:  You think you're drinking decaf, but your actually drinking an energy drink. You get the jitters.  You much be scared of something.  Something bad must be about to happen because otherwise why would you have the jitters.  OMG! You're psychic! You know something bad is about to happen!  Yeah, no. You're brain is stupid. That's all.
Well, the exact same thing is true with chemical depression.  Your bio-chemistry says ""you are depressed!"" so your brain says, ""Oh, it must be because.... um.... I hate my job! Or it's because I don't have a girlfriend! No, no, I know! My friends all hate me!""
So, when you're feeling down, ask yourself objectively: am I depressed because something is wrong, or am I depressed because my brain is stupid?
If you are feeling depressed and its made worse because there's no good reason for you to be depressed, you likely have chemical depression and should talk to a doctor about getting pills.  You can't talk therapy your way out of chemical depression.",not depression

"A New year a new me (long) : I have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last New Years, but I didn’t, the reason is I had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver, you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning. While still being at my worst at this point I made changes to improve myself, I lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times I took weed edibles etc. I did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss. I know I didn’t push myself to my full potential, I messed days up, and I mean that’s fine but I got off track and into a depressive state after those days, every New Years I reevaluate my life, to be or not to be, and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether I want to approach the next year at all. This year I’m cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where I push myself harder than I ever have to see if I can do it and whether there’s something out there worth it for me. I am going to give myself the best fighting chance I can. 

It’s easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it, and don’t get me wrong It’s hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head. 
But...I personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad. If we don’t fight what’s the fucking point right?

I read a post I think on here where they named their depression frank... I mean it’s also known as monkey brain. This has helped me quite a bit over the past year But yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank, say hi frank you can piss off now. Or swiper no swiping lol (Dora depressed lol) but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank. From there I like to torture frank, franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night. The way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domain(you). flex your arm right now, it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control, remember that, if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will (https://youtu.be/--j5sGlrqMk) you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him, and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank, cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive, if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing, rejuvenated and alive( if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart, shits a god damn drug to me,it hypes me the fuck up.) torture methods also include exercise, have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chest/neck, hell no. 

I am personally going to challenge many things I have already been doing and some I have been slacking on and new challenges.
My list includes; 
4:30 am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of 7 am, 
No masturbation for the whole year, its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit. You will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time. Anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year. 
cold showers
exercise/train hard with a program( up to you) and only 2 days off for recovery at max. Get light body weight/cardio on these days. 
half hour+of meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed. 
2 day bulking fasting routine(snake diet)(side note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts, I’ve lost over 100lbs on it, just do it, it will make your life so much easier and better. It changes your mindset, if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline, what’s stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort, which leads me to this post and my new years resolution)
Beyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion, dry year.
learn guitar and master 12 songs at least(singing too). 
Improve the workload I can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects. 
Get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so I’m not stressing out.
Naturally these habits will replace filler activities/bad habits/depressive habits like gaming/Netflix/getting high/staying in bed from 5pm to bedtime stuck in your head, for hours on end. I have pretty much cut all of these out, I need to work on YouTube a little still, I have already cut down my subscriptions to people I actually watch and enjoy and that might only be 2 to 3 videos a day I watch. Maybe one for you is social media addiction, I don’t use social, get off that shit, that ding notification dopamine hit you get, oh who texted me etc. What did this person post, why am I not getting likes on this post etc. Also if you post god damn everything you do online, there is nothing to talk about with another person for example. Ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them. 

I know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that, but this is where I call home for the past few years, I just wanted to share my guidelines I will follow for the year to decide it all. I know I am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post, Or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way. I’m tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if I just outthink frank that everything will be better, you can’t outthink feelings. it’s time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better. 

If anyone would like to join me this year on some challenges maybe we can have a thread dedicated to people who want to fight their depression to death. I’m tired of feeling and living this way and I’m sure I’m not the only one.",moderate

My neighbor come over... : About 2 hours ago someone knocks on my door. And she was in panic. Telling her boyfriend threatened to kill her. On top of that she has bruises All over her arms. And he has both of her kids. So me being me I tried walking over there and she told me he’s dangerous and has a gun. Me having lost everything.. thought this is my way out.. maybe just maybe I could help someone and lose my life in the process. So we walked over to her and he left one of the kids that wasn’t his in a crib. And stole her car with the other new born which was hers and his together. On top of this he was drunk as well. So she called the cops. So I stayed till the cops left and her family came to get her. Now that I’m relaxed and clear minded I was so selfish to wanna use someone else problem to solve me own. I kinda hate myself more then I already did. But the cops said they have warrant for his arrest and is being charged with all Kinds of shit. I hope they find him and get her child back.

She’s stubborn, sometimes she’s mean to me. I would worry about her all the time when she’s not with me and she’s having an episode because she would either run away from her house or cut. 

Sometimes when she’s not okay she’s mean to me. Not like “fuck you” mean but her way of just being sarcastic with all my genuine questions like “are you okay” or “im sorry If i said/did anythign wrong”. 

Often when she’s not okay when we’re face to face she doesn’t tell me what’s going on but I know something is wrong. Then she gets home and we’re texting. The second paragraph happens, then she starts saying how she doubts me and stuff like that. 

When she’s having really bad episodes during the night, I would pick her up from her house because again (she might cut or run away) and we would sleep in the car together.

It's very often that I see people here discussing their experience with therapy, psychiatry and mental healthcare. All of these vary according to every person, and in the case of the last aspect, every country. 
I'm a Spanish teenager and was interned after almost committing suicide in February 2019. A year ago now. I was put into a ward meant for adolescents (15-17), specifically. I live in a region with a population of nearly 5.000.000, whose total capacity for at-risk teens is... 5 rooms. Individual ones. Only 5 teens can receive attention. You will hardly ever see someone leave in less than 2 weeks, and you'll almost never see someone spend more than 4. It's just a quick fix. A patch. Momentary safety.
For all you who have gone through internment, what was your experience like?
For those who haven't, feel free to ask here. I would've preferred to know about it before heading right into it. It's useful info.",not depression
"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, but
no. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. 

My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. 

However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. 
The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. 

My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: 
I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.

But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.

things that disturbs me every day:
• Seeing someone sit alone
• Seeing someone being left out
• Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was bad
• seeing someone crying
• when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about it
• seeing someone being sad in general

All of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.

I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) 
There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. 
And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.

I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. 

I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" 
No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. 

This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.
Also english isnt my first language so if have messed up the grammar or something somewhere you know why",severe

"For all you students, many colleges/universities have services and programs for students with disabilities.

These services are incredibly helpful. In my case, I remember finally applying after finding out about these services (I found out too late unfortunately but oh well), and I was able to get extensions for schoolwork deadlines, extended/extra time during exams, and even class notes from a proctor who would take notes for me instead. All incredibly helpful! Now, every institution is different, perhaps not all schools have these services (that would really suck), and the perks/services you get may depend on you institution, but it's worth finding out. After all we pay so much for tuition, might as well take advantage for what we pay. And of course, many schools have counseling/therapy services as well.
