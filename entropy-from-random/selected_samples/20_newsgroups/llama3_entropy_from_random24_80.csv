pleasure tearing apart particularly illconsidered uninformed postings typical posting hitler atheist look response adolf hitler emphatically atheist said folkishminded man particular sacred duty

hence today believe acting accordance almighty creator bydefendingmyselfagainstthejewiam fightingfortheworkofthelordorig ital adolf hitler mein kampf trans ralph mannheim course someone bad believing something make belief wrong also entirely possible hitler lying claimed believe god certainly cant conclude hes atheist though typical posting bible says response readers altatheism feel bible questionable accuracy written thousands years ago many authors recording oral tradition existed many years thus claimed truth questionable legitimacy isnt say bible truth simply truth must examined accepted many readers group also feel passage subject interpretation claim passage means one thing one thing legitimate note feeling tends extend books also remarkable many atheists theists tend ignore equally plausible religious books favour religion typical posting believe god turn incorrect lost nothing dont believe god turn incorrect go hell therefore foolish atheist response argument known pascals wager several flaws firstly indicate religion follow indeed many mutually exclusive contradictory religions often described avoiding wrong hell problem person follower religion x may end religion ys version hell secondly statement believe god turn incorrect lost nothing true suppose youre believing wrong god true god might punish foolishness consider also deaths resulted people rejecting medicine favour prayer another flaw argument based assumption two possibilities equally likely least comparable likelihood fact possibility god close zero argument becomes much less persuasive sadly argument likely convince believe already also many feel intellectually honest people belief based evidence amount intuition matter costbenefit analysis formally speaking argument consists four statements one know whether god exists believing god bad ones eternal soul god exist believing god consequence god exist therefore ones interest believe god two approaches argument first view assumption consequence one problem approach abstract creates information information considered invalid information theory statement indicates one information god statement indicates beneficial information gained absolute lack information god violates information entropy information extracted information cost alternative approach claim assumptions problem basically assumption states christian position christian agree assumption argument thus collapses christian interests believe god rather vacuous tautology way pascal intended argument viewed biggest reason pascals wager failure god omniscient certainly know really believes believes wager spurn latter assuming actually cares whether people believe typical posting people keep talking occams razor response william occam formulated principle become known occams razor original form said multiply entities unnecessarily explain something without supposing existence entity nowadays people refer occams razor generally express generally example take simplest solution relevance atheism look two possible explanations see around us incredibly intricate complex universe came result natural processes incredibly intricate complex universe also god created universe clearly god must nonzero complexity given explanations fit facts occams razor might suggest take simpler two solution number one unfortunately argue third even simple solution isnt incredibly intricate complex universe imagine third option leads us logically towards solipsism many people find unacceptable typical posting want tell people virtues

theory universe closed finite extent beginning end argument design often stated analogy socalled watchmaker argument one asked imagine one found watch beach one assume created watchmaker evolved naturally course one assumes watchmaker yet like watch universe intricate complex argument goes universe must creator watchmaker analogy suffers three particular flaws common arguments design firstly watchmaker creates watches preexisting materials whereas god claimed created universe nothing two sorts creation clearly fundamentally different analogy therefore rather weak secondly watchmaker makes watches many things world walked along beach found nuclear reactor wouldnt assume created watchmaker argument would therefore suggest multitude creators responsible different part creation finally first part watchmaker argument conclude watch part nature ordered therefore stands randomness nature yet second part argument start position universe obviously random shows elements order watchmaker
