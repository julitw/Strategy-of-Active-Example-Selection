interpretations others simply address issues see verses clearly address issues exactly zero verses clearly address issues agree verses gone unchallenged gay rights activists zero verses clearly address issues doesnt mean also verses clearly support case sure want say zero verses clearly address issues however couple seem though require incredibly perverse interpretations order seen condemning homosexuality kind interpretation see incredibly perverse applied story sodom blanket equation homosexual behavior rape since christians citing bible context presumed least read story amounts slander charge homosexuality rape use us story genesis tells citizens sodom demanding opportunity know two men lots guests fact sodomites became angry lot offered daughters could seen indicating interested homosexual intercourse yes wanted rape homosexual rape everybody agrees wrong christians believe homosexual aspect desire sinful rape aspect desire passage say offended god whether homosexuality intended rape believe fair consider possible alternatives light related scriptures believe believe god offended homosexuality rape trying say homosexuality form rape seems take view sin described gen fact sodomites wanted commit rape unfair stigmatize homosexuality associating sin rape see might reach conclusion started conclusion nothing wrong homosexuality supposed start conclusions thats circular reasoning god fact opposed homosexual intercourse general probably interpretation least offended sodomites blatant homosexuality intent commit rape later document believe old testament portrays god one despises homosexual intercourse even partners consenting adults deceived neither fornicators idolators adulterers effeminate homosexuals thieves covetous drunkards revilers swindlers shall inherit kingdom god cor moderator adequately discusses circularity use porneia moderator found proposal circular regarded church proper authority determining kinds marriages would legitimate thus churchs refusal recognize perverted marriages circular reasoning questions however nothing church ordaining new kinds marriages argument something straw man terms original question precise definitiontranslation porneia isnt really important unless trying argue bible doesnt really condemn extramarital sex im sure moderator trying case think moderator missed point jesus asked divorce replied read created beginning made male female said cause man shall leave father mother shall cleave wife two shall become one flesh consequently longer two one flesh therefore god joined together let man separate mt read sexual union man male wife female divinelyordained union words institution heterosexual marriage something ordained established godnot men church god men supposed dissolve union jesus words something created men circular reasoning reading gods word read bible god ordained union male female read similar divinelyordained union two males two females granted uninspired men ordained alternative unions isnt caligula reported married horse union jesus refers god joined together heterosexual union man wife pardon mentioning caligula know thats probably inflammatory save discussion bestiality part post please hold passing judgement read section reply anyway original question whether translate porneia way condemns select kinds extramarital sex question given heterosexual marriage union described bible divinelyordained given biblical prohibition sex outside marriage homosexual intercourse sinful course see first need ask whether bible really condemns sex outside marriage seem trying argue certain kinds extramarital sex sins really wrong think agree paul kinds activity could named fornication theft coveting reviling drunkenness would well deserve condemnation may may agree bounds categories however fact argued suggests matter clear paul excellent rhetorician interest making clear leaving matters rather spiritled decisions uncomfortable livingwithotherreadings dominated christian discussion areas alternatively may definition terms porneia rest pauls day would call faq ie law tutor appointed god lead us christ spent sixteen centuries drumming heads gods people idea things like homosexual intercourse abominations deserved punishment death perhaps paul didnt go detail porneia c years considered question dealt already perhaps reason gods apostles prophets devote great deal time defining distinct new testament sexuality intend significant changes sexuality already established law ill discuss law homosexuality greater detail wanted point new testaments failure develop detailed new standard sexuality necessarily evidence god care sexual conductespecially years putting people death practicing homosexuality homosexual behavior different gay christians know adamant condemning rape heterosexual homosexual child molestation heterosexual homosexual even possibly harmless obsessive kinds sex heterosexual homosexual would stand condemned paul continuation chapter cite may mildly suggest paul letter want use perhaps good guide meaning free anything say yes everything good doubt free anything one let anything make free cor restatement must god god commandment neither gay christian wishes break people indeed involved obsessively driven modes sexual behavior wrong though slightly less incendiary secondary argument phobic contingent equate homosexuality behavior equate rape gods messengers define obsessively driven mode sexual behavior determine difference obsessive sexual behavior normal sex drives desire sinful sex obsessively driven mode behavior think see circular reasoning defined sinful obsessive makes obsessive fact person driven seek even though sinful obsessive desire society condemns thats circular defined obsessive person wants even though society condemns society condemn obsessive seem trying limit bibles condemnation porneia perverted sex acts dont think really define perverted without falling exactly circularity accuse paul condemning declares fornicatorsshall enter kindgom heaven wont deal exegesis leviticus except tangentially fundamentally exhibiting circularity assumption know porneia means think misunderstood trying make argument technical definition porneia raising issues sinfulness extramarital sex lack scriptural evidence homosexual counterpart divinelyordained union heterosexual couples plenty laws prohibiting sexual behavior found leviticus christians ignore completely never even bother examine assume know ones moral
