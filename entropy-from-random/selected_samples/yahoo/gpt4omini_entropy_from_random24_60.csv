"Title: Evolution?why are'nt we still evolveing?where is the half man'half monkeys?, Content: , Answer: Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. This theory, which claims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was invalidated by the scientific evidence of clear ""design"" in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.\nYet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This \n""intelligent design"" is a scientific expression of the fact that God created all living things.\n\n\n(THE SCIENTIFIC COLLAPSE OF DARWINISM)\n\nAlthough this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, published in 1859. In this book, he denied that God created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an ""assumption."" Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled ""Difficulties of the Theory,"" the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. \nDarwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:\n1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. \n2) No scientific finding shows that the ""evolutionary mechanisms"" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all. \n3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests.\n\nThe power evolutionists impute to the three force they believe to have produced life—time, mud, and chance—is actually enough to elevate them into a trinity. They believe that the combination of these random forces gave shape to the human brain, intelligence, cognitive ability, judgment and memory.\nIn this section, I will examine these three basic points in general outlines:\n\n\nThe First Insurmountable Step: \n(The Origin of Life)\n\nThe theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this ""first cell"" originate?\nSince the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the ""first cell"" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement.

It is only one component of the entire equation.  Equally important is your form, the number of reps and sets you do, how long your workout is, how much rest you take in between sets, the speed of both the concentric component and the eccentric component, and others as well.  The push/pull method just happens to be one of the more popular ways of lifting.\n\n\nOne advantage of this method is that you are exercising muscles that wrok together in one session.  For example, usually the pecs and the triceps are worked in the same sessions.  The triceps work as a synergist during most pec movements (meaning they help the pecs to complete the movement).  So that if you do your chest workout first, then you do have to work your triceps as hard because they have been pre-exhaust by the chest workout.\n\nOn the other hand, by seperating synergistic muscle groups, for example doing triceps and chest on seperate days, then the triceps will get worked twice as many times during the week -- once during the workout specifically aimed at the triceps, and once as a synergist during the chest workout.\n\nFor more information on all off this, see the link below.
