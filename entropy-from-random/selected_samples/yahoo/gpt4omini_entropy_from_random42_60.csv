If we examined all these things down to the root we would see that society is definitely headed in the wrong direction, and genetic engineering is a part of that.\nIt's of no long term benefit to the human race.",Education & Reference

Some squirt, or pour a lot?, Answer: The substance isn't really like juice, but that is a slang term for it, yes.  It's kinda slimy and slippery, actually, and it's meant to help the penis slide in and out of the vagina.  Without it, sex can be really painful.  That wetness varies with women, and within a single woman's lifetime.  Arousal, stress, age, time of the month- these all affect how wet a woman gets.\n\nSome women do ejaculate, too.  That substance is different from the arousal fluids, and it's not semen, either.  I don't think they know yet what exactly it is, and I've heard everything from pee to a semen-like fluid that we produce.

"Title: I have a serious question for religious people about evolution?, Content: lets say that you believed evolution to be true.   is the reason why evolution so controversial because it will prove the bible is wrong? not even about god creating the earth but because of the age of the earth itself?  i dont wanna try to sound like im dissing religion but i wanna know why it is bad to be taught in the first place, Answer: Evolution is just a theory. Now scientists have come up with another theory of Intelignet being because they are unable to answer many questions with the help of Evolution alone.\nWho is this inteligent being ? This is surely God.\n\nThe earth as it is today has evolved over billions of years (as claimed by the theory of evolution) itself is just like saying that\nyou can build a 747 Boeing aircraft by placing all the componets in a building and all the parts get entangled due to a storm and viola a plane is born.",Society & Culture
