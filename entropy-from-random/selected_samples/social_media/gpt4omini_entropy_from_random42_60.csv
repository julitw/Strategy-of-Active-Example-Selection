"Emotional Depression vs Chemical Depression &amp; how the mind reacts : Many of you probably know this but just in case...
If you have emotional depression, it's because something bad happened recently.  You lost your job and bills are piling up, your best friend died, you lost a child, whatever.  It's an emotional response to a life event.  Things suck right now, but they can and will get better because of time.  You aren't the first person to be in this situation, you won't be the last person. Hang in there, get what help you can.
If you have chemical depression, it's because your body isn't making the right amount of the right chemical, or it's going through the right chemical but too quickly, etc.  This is like having diabetes. It's not caused by an event, it's not a reaction to something which has happened or is likely to happen. It's a medical condition that you need medicine to control.  Yes, some people can achieve help with diet changes, some people can exercise their way out, but in all cases it's still a bio-chemical problem.
Talk therapy is not going to fix chemical depression.  Changing jobs is not going to fix chemical depression.  Having kids is not going to fix chemical depression.
Now, here's the kicker -- your brain is fucking stupid. It does not control the body, it justifies the body. If you eat a pizza and then later feel sick, your brain decides it was the pizza.  It may be that you have the flu and the pizza has nothing to do with it, but your brain is looking for cause and effect, so until it gets convinced otherwise, you hate pizza.
Another example:  You think you're drinking decaf, but your actually drinking an energy drink. You get the jitters.  You much be scared of something.  Something bad must be about to happen because otherwise why would you have the jitters.  OMG! You're psychic! You know something bad is about to happen!  Yeah, no. You're brain is stupid. That's all.
Well, the exact same thing is true with chemical depression.  Your bio-chemistry says ""you are depressed!"" so your brain says, ""Oh, it must be because.... um.... I hate my job! Or it's because I don't have a girlfriend! No, no, I know! My friends all hate me!""
So, when you're feeling down, ask yourself objectively: am I depressed because something is wrong, or am I depressed because my brain is stupid?
If you are feeling depressed and its made worse because there's no good reason for you to be depressed, you likely have chemical depression and should talk to a doctor about getting pills.  You can't talk therapy your way out of chemical depression.",not depression

"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate

"Depression or laziness? : For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 
Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.
Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time. This has been going on for at least a year or two and I really need to get work done and get on with my life so I don't fall behind. Any help would be appreciated :)",moderate

"parents suck : I’m very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn’t really affect me except for with my family.

My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I’m annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don’t see me as much as they used to’. Basically I can’t do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don’t avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much’, which really can’t be done. 

On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we’re currently in and spent the night outside (we’re on a ski vacation, it get’s below -15°C here at night). Said I have to go to therapy for being annoyed (I’ve went to therapy before, it really did not work for me). My mother joined in and asked why I couldn’t just be a normal child.

"I’ve begun to give up hope on doing anything well. I literally cannot do anything right anymore, cannot do anything well. 2020 is just going to be a reminder of how much time I’ve wasted. : Maybe this isn’t right to throw my thoughts out, but I just need to vent I think. With the new year of 2020 here, I honestly feel that I should be something more than I was excluding wisdom gained from aging. Growing up I was a huge gamer and I love games always have. I’ve also loved going into different skills and hobbies including cooking, drawing, instruments, and others. Then comes 2019, I just lose my ability to do everything. The people around me say that what I do is good, but that just isn’t true. They’re just being nice and can’t see that the numbers just don’t add up. I cooked a steak for my family a while back, and while they said they enjoyed it, when I took a bite I honestly felt like breaking down just a little. It was so god awful that I told them I refuse to eat it. I got up and walked away. Didn’t eat dinner that night. I just wanna feel good at something. Anything. The one thing I thought, I had some sort of skill. Some sort of worth, was in games. I grew up with it, played years worth. So why do I suck so damn badly? Moba’s I just seem to never be able to do the right thing at the right time, constantly being flamed. FPS’s people constantly ask if I’m intentionally deranking. MMO’s I can’t even do the end game content because I just don’t have the items to do it, and I refuse to pay to win. I usually don’t let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can’t do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to. I lost practically everyone I used to know, and they moved on. Everyone does eventually. I don’t know if I’m depressed but, I feel like my worth is zero to none at this point. I told myself for the longest time, 2020 is gonna be my year, my strongest year yet, I’m a day in and I already feel like giving up. Pathetic right.",moderate

"Meaningless.. : I really don’t wanna put extra negative thoughts in others heads but i just feel really down on the realisation that a human life is meaningless..

I mean, i used to believe in destiny, fate and all that stuff and to this day I still believe that the human mind is capable of more than we are lead to believe (harder to back it with action whilst living with mental illness). But so many things that are wrong with this world and so many things happening that just make me feel so insignificant..

What was that starved to death child in Africa’s destiny? What was that baby that died at births destiny? What was the 1345th person out of 5000 that commit suicide in the UK every years destiny?... 

I watched this video on Youtube the other day about 5 teens getting sentenced to jail for murder. They were throwing large stones off a bridge onto a motorway and one of them killed a father of 3 on his way home from work... And i seen a comment on it that said “Imagine living your whole life, having kids with your wife only to be killed on your way home from work by some stupid teens”.... And fuck that hit hard.. That guy is now dead. That guy that contributed more to society and probably more for his kids then I’ve done in my life and his existence was just wiped out. Some kids just doing stupid kid stuff and shot that man out of existence. Now what the fuck was his destiny??.. Where was the “everything falls into place at the right time” meaning in his fucking story....
It really makes me think on how nothing actually really fucking matters. We live in a much better society then the people 1000 years ago and can you imagine the suicide rate then? And how many of those people do you have the faintest clue about that existed..

We like to fill our heads with bullshit on how we are the centre of the Universe and all that shit but you really think god cares about the 1 of his infinite living creations.. We are the most intelligent species on our planet but our lives hold as much significance as that ant you accidentally stepped on on your way to work. Or that spider you killed because you didn’t like the way it looked. Or that flower you picked that eventually withered and died..

If there is any meaning to our very very very short time we spend being sentient. It is what we give it.. And I can’t see anything more meaningful than trying your best to embody good in this cruel world.. This world suffers so much and there’s nothing that should make you feel more proud of your existence than doing what is right.. You have to look out for yourself and your own well-being but give some of what you have spare to others..
This world needs kindness and compassion and generosity more than ever.. We as humans have the most tainted past. But strive to be the difference..

Give your spare change to that homeless man. Let someone infront of you in queue. Give up your seat for someone standing on public transport. Stand in protest against climate change, corrupt governments, unjustified wars, terrorism, poverty, homelessness, Etc.. All the little things create just that little bit extra kindness in the world.. 

All of you that are on this board know pain. Know suffering. Know what it is like to fester in negativity..
Don’t be a multiplier of this pain.. Be an example of the society that you wished you lived in.. You may not contribute as much as you want towards society. But you gave abit of whatever light you have left to someone else. And made there light just abit brighter. In that moment you were the god that gifted someone else. Wether that be stopping a kid from being bullied or sparing the life of that spider.. At that moment you were in charge of making a difference to someones life. And you gave them happiness. And that gives your life meaning...",moderate

I feel like I'm losing my mind or I'm dying and I dunno what to do I have no drive or feelings for anyone or anything I've had plenty of sexual experiences but felt nothing for any of them what do I do from here in the new year to improve my life?",moderate
"I'm deleting reddit : I've been on reddit for some time now but I'm done with it. It only seems to make me more depressed and more angry, so I decided it's not worth it even if I'm going to miss some things from here.

I've been really sick of a lot of other social media like Instagram and twitter which I also deleted. I don't know if this will actually help me or not, but I definitely don't want to be here right now.

The years I spent on this subreddit and some other mental health related ones definitely helped me understand myself but also other people.

I'll still stay for sometime before I delete it. I'm doing much better than when I created this account, and I sincerely hope this sub and many others like it help out more people like me. I was so alone at one point in my life where I had no one to talk to and talked on here instead which helped ease my loneliness a bit.

Thank you and goodbye",moderate

"I'm lost : what the fuck. i always knew people experienced life like this but i never thought it was going to happen to me, too. i have never been this alone in my life, or felt like it. finishing highschool helped me realize it, new years made me realize it even more. i don't know why i keep expecting some kind of attention for me. it never happens. maybe i was expecting some kind of message of new years, even when i have not received any kind of text for a week. completely forgotten, can't blame anyone

i'm only 17 and i am fucking doomed in this world",moderate
"Exhausted by apathy and being stuck in life, should I surrender and go on antidepressants again? : I have an appointment to see my doctor next week as I am completely stuck in life and cannot get ahead - constantly doubting myself, negativity, complete apathy. But I really want to move on and be happy. I have been on antidepressants before, and they did help me get out of a slump however some of the side effects and weaning off them were awful. Are there an other alternatives to antidepressants? (I will go back into therapy when I am back on my feet) Or should I go back on meds and make an effort to take them?",moderate
"Anyone else overcome with numbness? : I’m (32F) medicated for long-standing depression and anxiety. The medication is working, and I’m not suicidal. 

The issue is, most days I’m not anything. I wake up, and I go through the motions. I have a job, a partner and a preschooler son. Sometimes I I find my job and my family enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. I am rarely joyful, or excited, or particularly interested in anything other than my bed and the occasional television show. Before depression and my subsequent medication, I used to be a voracious reader. I don’t do that anymore. The words swim on the page and I can’t sustain my interest. I used to enjoy conversations with my friends too. Nowadays I don’t have the energy or mental wherewithal to sustain anything beyond basic small talk. I used to take an interest in politics and theoretical discussions but I don’t feel like I have the capacity to do so on any meaningful level now. 

I am occasionally overwhelmed by the pointlessness and cruelty of the world generally. This will strike at unexpected times - when I see the carcass of an animal at the roadside, or a beggar in the street. I wonder whether I will ever have a meaningful connection ever again, or whether I will ever feel anything beyond such numbness. 

My question is, is there anything one can do to break through the numbness, or even soften it a bit? I don’t want to cease the medication, because prior to taking it I wasn’t functioning. But I feel like I’m living a half-life, in a bubble where I am watching everything unfold but nothing is touching me.",moderate
"I feel like giving up and I dont know who to talk here's me rambling : So I have been on a journey to find my way of expressing myself through art and I've been trying to pursue it but I cant help to think I will never be good enough for anything. Either in art or hell even in relationships with a significant other and family. I always feel like a burden... My temptation to self destruct is always trying to put me in, through lust and selfishness. Although I try my best to fight them but its SO DIFFICULT. I dont know if something Is wrong with me or if this is normal but good god... if this is normal why do I even try?!... I Care so much about the person I am with and he is so patient and understanding but I feel if I would let him know about this lustful side of me he would would have really bad anxiety with me and leave. I dont have any friends or family around me so this is... just me. I'm so alone.

I guess you can say I'm using this app to cent but goodness if anyone has tips or support please through it at me.",moderate
"meh : i wish i didnt see reality as it is. i wish i had some goals to achieve, some sort of purpose, happiness would be cool too. instead im always by myself 24/7 even if im with other people, and thats it. it makes me sad, that a decade has passed. life goes by so quick its insane

 i don't wanna feel happy at this point, so no meds for me. reality sucks, and i just have to get used to facing it everyday. i question if this reality isn't hell, because sometimes it feels like life is just out to get me. i sometimes worry about going to hell, but what if this is hell? 

the funny thing is that i dont mean jack shit. theres 7 billion people here. not to mention in the observable universe i am literally just a speck. however my brain doesn't see it like this. life is a huge mind-fuck. x  10000000000000000000",moderate
"Life is boring as fuck : I hate being around people, I hate work, video games got boring and I hate life in general. I sometimes wonder why I even bother with life anymore because there’s nothing I want to do or accomplish with my time. It’s all so boring and I hate how I have to live like this every fucking day. Trying out new things gets boring after a short amount of time and then I’m back to square one. Life is a such fucking joke and I hate it so much",moderate
"Ex boyfriend shamed me on Facebook : Even tho there were problems in our very short relationship, reading comments from people I don't know, saying that I don't have depression, that I am a psychopath and a manipulative asshole really hurts (both me and my mum who was the first one to read the post).

The post is on a big fb group with a lot of people and they don't allow named accusations, but still... I get that he needed some closure, but that caused a lot of damage to my mental health. It hurts knowing that a lot of people including mutual friends read about my depression and sexual problems like some kind of a joke.",moderate
"on paper i had a good day : everything went well today.  i saw everyone i wanted  to see, and things have been going well with this girl i’ve been talking to but i still feel fucking terrible.  i want to feel fine but i just can’t.  i feel so hopeless and no matter what i do or how my day goes i always find myself feeling shitty.  i was down about a breakup for most of last year but i was feeling better in December, and i’ve been feeling down in a similar way for the last two months now.  it hasn’t really gotten better.  before when i’d feel down i always felt like it got a little easier every day but i don’t feel way that anymore and i have been feeling hopeless lately.  i don’t know what to do.  i just want to feel ok and like nothing is wrong again.  if you guys have any ideas or advice or experiences you want to share i’d really appreciate it.",not depression
"I think I forgot how to exist : I’m just here. It’s Christmas, which normally I LOVE. I love snow, I love lights and all the weather, but I’ve felt so completely empty the past two months. I can feel my life moving and I feel like I’m not even seeing or feeling any of it. I’m just going through all the motions, and I’m starting to panic a bit because everybody is acting like this is completely normal. Like I keep telling them something is very wrong with me right now and no one believes me or sees anything wrong. I’m scared because I feel so disconnected from everything I used to love, including the people around me. I’m really stressed about it and I am not sure how to help this. I tried to get an appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist, but they couldn’t get me in until February. My counselor is overbooked because it’s at the university and she is always swamped. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",moderate

This world is making me go insane : Its the first day of 2020 and i hope that everyone else sees the world in my perspective but i just cant take it anymore i know someone will disagree with me and proably downvote this post for having a different opinion but I’m just gonna say it when these HK protest started i didn’t care but when i heard of people getting hurt on both sides i started to act a little skeptical and concerned one day i posted a video of a chinese man getting set on fire on r/morbidlyreality and all i got was “this is fake” and “your just the ten cent army” and when i saw a picture of a protestor who got hit in the face with a gas canister everyone was supporting him and saying whoever did this were monsters and I’m like ok then so i can sucker punch an old man for having a different opinion but if he has your opinion then I’m the monster this revelation just changed everything its all “FREE HK” i see everywhere but never stopping and thinking “maybe my side has done bad things too” but when i say this I’m suddenly the dumbass who hates democracy all of you are just saying this because it looks cool and never think fuck all of you its making me insane i don’t know what to do all i hear is HK HK HK i just want it to stop i want people to just be kind to each other i don’t know  what to do anymore,severe

"Dental Care Tips? : So, I'm narcoleptic and depressed. These are my two biggest disorders so I have literally no energy to take care of myself most days. My teeth are kinda neglected at the moment but I am fortunate enough to have regular dental cleanings every six months like they recommend, but that's not enough in between appointments. I'm primarily concerned about my gum health and I believe my dentist is as well.

Basically all I'm asking is how can I take extra care to make sure my teeth don't fall out when I'm thirty...? Anything and everything is appreciated.",moderate
