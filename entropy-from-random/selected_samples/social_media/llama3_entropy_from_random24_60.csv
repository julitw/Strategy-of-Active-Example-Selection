"Considering trying to get antidepressants. Scare to start and worried about weight gain. : I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression (moderately high functioning though) and anxiety but I didn’t have the right kind of insurance to do anything about it. I’ve got a primary doctor picked out (haven’t had one in like five years) and a therapist picked out. I just can’t work up the guts to make the appointments. I’m absolutely terrified that I’ll talk to the doctor about it and they’ll deny me getting antidepressants and that therapy won’t help. If I try and it fails then that’s the final nail in the coffin, there’s no hope because I tried so much already. 

And there’s the looming possible weight gain. I’m 5’3” female and 205lbs. I went from a very fit 142lbs (26% body fat) in 2015 to 205lbs (42% body fat) and out of shape now. I know how to eat well and I love exercising but I just can’t anymore. I despise how I look already so being super depressed sounds better than continuing to gain weight. 

How am I supposed to walk into a new doctor and be like “hey, doc. I’m super depressed and anxious as fuck. How about some antidepressants? Oh and none that’ll make me gain weight. K thanks.” (Obviously I would be more professional, I’m just making jokes as coping.)",moderate

"i was recently diagnosed with depression : Hello, as my titled says, I was recently diagnosed with depression. I don’t know where else to tell my story but I feel like I need to do it to prevent myself from doing something bad. I’m 18, I live in France and i’ve started going to college in September. Since then, I was feeling really off, as if I was some kind of second character in other people’s lives, but also in my own. I was feeling really lonely, but seeing my other friends feeling the same way reassured me in this feeling. However, as the time went by, I saw those same people gradually becoming better while I wasn’t, and I started losing contact with them. I used to be really friendly, always laughing and going out, while being really dedicated to my studies. Since then, it’s just as if everything just started becoming black. I’ve lost interest in going out, making jokes and laughing didn’t light the same sparkle in me, studying made me feel dumb and empty. I constantly feel like i’ve chosen the wrong path, but feel like i’m not good enough for another one, and i always wanted to come back to my parents but i wasn’t feeling right in my place anywhere. It started to became more and more frequent, with thoughts of quitting everything, or that I didn’t belong anywhere, etc. I didn’t want to go out anymore, or when I did, I just needed to drink to feel in a right headspace, or else I just felt as if I was standing aside of my own body, not knowing how to act or what to say to make believe that I was doing okay when really I wasn’t. I started to see my college’s psychologist but he really didn’t help me and instead made me feel really weird about myself and the way I felt. I spoke about it to my mother, which wasn’t that concerned because I hadn’t told her yet that I was thinking a lot about death and suicide. She helped me find a psychologist, which I started to see every week, since february. She immediately told me that she thought I had depression and needed to take medicine, and so I had to go see a psychiatrist to get them. With my psychologist, we talk a lot about my life in the past and how I could see the world as another point of view, and she makes me think of a lot of things about me, but really she just points out a lot of things that i do or am that kind of make me sad about myself. What really scared me is that I usually enjoyed a lot going to concerts, which made me really happy and the last two i went to made me feel so much anxiety and discomfort that I had to go out before the end. I was really disappointed towards myself. By then, I tried going to several places to find a psychiatrist but no one helped me or took me seriously and I felt like I would never be helped, and I felt like I didn’t really want to on the inside. I wrote a suicide note, and I was ready to try to kill me. My boyfriend saw it and he prevented my mother, which came by me crying saying she didn’t know I had the intention to do it. We went to a hospital to seek medical help but there were a lot of kids who were really sick and I didn’t feel at the right place at all. We finally found a psychiatrist, which diagnosed me with depression, and anxiety. She gave me meds that I have to take daily and are supposed to make me feel happy again. I hate it because everytime I want to swallow the entire pack, whether it is to die or get better quicker. I started questioning myself if I had always been depressed. I’ve always felt as if I wasn’t part of this world in some way, or that I didn’t deserve to be here.
Now, i’m not better at all but I like writing down my feelings. I’m living normally and i’m trying to do stuff to keep me occupied but i’m always bored because I always want to do something but I never know what; I’m vainly angry at people that love me because they love me; when i cross a crosswalk I always think of a car hitting me and then of me suffering; I always want to sleep to forget that im alive; When I laugh I feel like I shouldn’t be doing it; I feel like i’m not really depressed because my problems aren’t important; I feel like i’m useless and that I’ll never be important to anyone; I feel like my life is pointless and that it’ll never change; I feel like I should always excuse myself because I’m not a good person; I feel like the ugliest person in the world; and sometimes I just burst into tears because it is just too much and the weight is too heavy and I want to take it off. 
That’s my story dealing with depression. Everyday I wake up knowing that one day I’ll take my life away, but I want to get better; because people get hurt because of me. I’m hurting them because I deeply hate myself and I’m constantly fighting against myself. 
I hope i’ll get better.",severe

"I think 2020 is the year I do it : I've been struggling with depression since I was 16. I have no goals and no ambition to become anything important. I just wanna hit the whole reset button on life. Everyone around me is growing up and moving on without me. My family is tired of my shit. My friends are tired of my shit. I can even go to family gathering anymore cause everyone's tired of my dramatic depression. I don't even complain about it when I'm out. I just speak and everyone gets angry at me. I spent new year's Eve alone trying to drink myself to death. I just recently quit my job cause I don't wanna work anymore. I feel like it's coming to an end very soon and I'm honestly kinda happy when I think about it. Seriously, what's the point in getting old? What's the point in having a career? What's the point of starting a family? We all go to the same place in the end. Might as well just do it before I get older.",moderate
"What it do, why is this. : So I’ve grown up with parents who were not a good pair. They fought a lot and screamed at each other my whole growing up. It came to the point my mom would leave tinge house and my dad wouldn’t let her. I would have to follow them outside and force my dad to stop holding the car door on my mom. Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. I get very anxious and uncomfortable . Sometimes get nauseous. Why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what.

"(23F) Separated from husband with 50/50 custody of 2 year old : I suffered pretty bad from PPD after having my son. It didn’t help that my husband was toxic and had his own problems. Now we’re on better terms but separated and he’s paying for me to live in my own 3 bedroom house, for the sake of it feeling like another home for my stepkids. Totally love that it’s awesome. But 95% of the time it’s me and half of the week it’s my son and I. I’ve been eating right and exercising daily for the past month and a half, feeling so good about myself. Yesterday I got my son back and was so happy. I meal prepped in the kitchen with fun music while simultaneously playing with my kiddo. A really amazing day. Well today I could hardly get out of bed when he woke up at 5. Obviously that’s wayyyyy too early for anyone so I just put it off as being tired. But then I noticed a pattern. When he’s here, he wakes up early, we have way too much screen time in the morning because for three hours I physically cannot get out of bed (for anything for myself but I’ll grab him his breakfast/snacks/diaper and we will just be in bed). Then I just feel like I can’t do anything. Dishes?? No fucking way!! I haven’t done laundry in forever, and my house after three months still isn’t fully furnished. I type that and think I’m just lazy. But holy hell, I took my son to the museum today and that was the biggest feat I think I’ve ever pulled. Just making that move to get out of bed, get myself dressed, get him dressed, leave the house... now I feel so heavy. My head actually feels pressure pushing me down. I don’t want to do anything. I had a three day streak where I didn’t brush my teeth or my hair, and that’s still while dieting and exercising. I think I am always depressed, but on some days I can do more things than others and distract myself. 
Anyway. Meeting my STB ex tonight with my stepkids for a show. Another thing that I have to force myself to do without thinking of vomiting.",severe
"Is there anyone who can relate to my symptoms? : I have been diagnosed with depression and anixety for 9 years but I'm not even sure at this point that it's the correct diagnosis. None of my treatments have worked, SSRIs made me worse and SNRIs only fixed minor symptoms like mood. Therapy and CBT do not work. And I feel so alone because the more I try and reach out, or find information about what I'm going through online, the more I realise that I'm alone in this.
I cannot get out of bed, and barely eat. I have not lost motivation or ambition, but it's like I'm physically trapped in my body. My attention span and memory are terrible, I can barely remember what I did yesterday. I feel anxiety constantly, even when I'm doing nothing or trying to relax. I can't keep a routine or care for myself because I feel I cannot physically move anymore. I get hypersomnia and at worst I can sleep for up to 24 hours, but my average is usually about 12. My mind races and the only time I ever feel normal is when I manage to distract myself and literally forget about reality. And I get this really weird feeling that never disappears, it feels like a physical pain that's numb. Like, imagine your arm is numb and then you pinch it really hard. You can tell that your arm is having a sensation of pain, but without the actual pain being felt. It's like that for me everyday. I am just trapped in this bed slowly starving.
The only conditions I have ever managed to find that might explain this are catatonic depression and/or psychomotor retardation. But it is so hard for me to find information online about these, and my doctors and therapist do not discuss it with me much. I know I should really fight for them to discuss it with me but I'm so anxious when I get there that I let them walk over me.
Please, is there anyone out there who feels the same symptoms as I do? I just don't want to be alone, I want to strong and know that I can get better.",severe

"I am struggling with every aspect of my life : Background: 27/F of south asian decent. I struggled a lot with my feeling in highschool. I has a estranged relationship with my parents. They had moved to Canada and has white collar jobs back home but here they felt frustrated and more often than not they would take it out on me. I worked on farms and helped ends meet. I quickly realized I wasn't quite like the other kids, falling for boys and doing the popular thing. I started to become very internalized and depressed. I even tried to kill myself a few times. But I was chicken shit and never did manage to succeed. My parents pressured me to do online classes skip a grade and be smart. I did most, but in grade 12 I was struggling a lot. I finished school with a great GPA, but I never finished my online class. I just had too much on my plate( my mental health was really bad here) anyways I decided to switch my major and take that class while I did the other intro classes at school. I told my parents, they decide I was horrible and I got yet another beating. I tried to keep it up. I was 17 and too scared to take a student loan so I got a night job and started working and school.during the day. With my mental health being the way it was and animosity at home I was struggling. My grades at school.staryed to drop, I started to get worse and worse. After two semester and realizing I wasnt going to succeeed I decided to quit school, I moved out and spent a month just sleeping. I was so mentally exhausted. I then looked for a job. I found a decent job working in a lab, I started to save as I eventually wanted to return to university. I went back to tutoring, since I was tutoring in highschool some of my networks were still around, so I approached them. Back in highschool I used to tutor at my parents home. The students asked if I was able to do that again. I approached my parents hesitant, offered to share part of my earning and tutor there. They said sure 50-50. Hey that was more money than I was making now so it would only help me save more. Time goes on, our relationship seems better, they tell me they miss me and I should move home. I am foolish because I believe them as I am moving home a year later. Enrolling in local college to do a bridge program and get into the program I want. I am lonely and have no friends and my parents are back to yelling and hating me. I look for friends more importantly I am looking for love. Highschool people made jokes about me being gay to me, I ignored them. Ofcourse they weren't wrong. But I wasn't the in crowd so I couldn't afford to be gay aswell. So here I am thinking I am on path to sorting my shit out at 19 and I meet this woman at the college. She seems really interested we hit it off, she tell me she loves me and I am puddy. I do everything she wants. Things at my home are tense so i find any and every excuse to stay out and with her. One day she needs financial help and I being an idiot let her have my savings with a promise she will return them within a semester and then she changes. She starts seeing exes and new people. She calls me names, she makes me feel gross about myself and I gain a bunch of weight. My doctor says my health is no good. I am hardly sleeping. I am prescribed xanax. I hate it so I just let myself cry for days and not leave my room. I started seeing a counselor at the college. Cut back to taking just one class so I can have health insurance and work for a year and half and save. Get a car. My.parents are fighting everything i do. Constantly calling me names, I am still being beat up. I start going to jiu jitsu. At 24, I get a handle on my head a bit. I have sat down and decide I am.taking a student loan and studying. I study hard and finishing the engineering bridge program. I have meet someonei think I like I am taking it slow.I had applied to school close but not in the same city so I could justify moving. I am 25 So I move to the island near my city and get admission to a good engineering school. I go to visit the person I have been seeing. I like her, I am open with her, she understands my past. She is sick though and getting better. She is living in south africa with her family. I only see her for 2 weeks. I return start university. I work my ass off and focus. I get an internship. I work hard, I struggle, I am sad every day. I am 26,My mother had gone through my bank stuff and found I has bought a vibrator. We fight, yells and tells me how much of disgrace I am. I have a ring I had bought for the woman I had been seeing. She is sick and can't move to canada so I want to marry her. That find sends me backwards. I had to tried to tell me parent a million times how I feel and the fact i gay, she keeps bringing up marriage to men. If she find a purchase so horrible how will she react to me marrying a woman. I tell my girlfriend how I am feeling, she tells me not to worry and do it at my pace and take my time. She tells me she is okay, she will wait as long as it takes. I see her again for 2 weeks, I love her and her family loves me. Seeing them makes me feel like I am so alone. I feel lonely most days but i am very aware now. 

I am sitting here today watching everyone post a recap of their decade showing their accomplishments and here is am.not even halfway through my degree, lonely and scared, uncomfortable in my skin. Unsure of how to come out how to find a balance between the guilt I feel for not being a good daughter or staying in hiding and forever losing the person I love if not today then someday. I am sitting here in tears wondering when things got so messy, when I became so alone, when no one remembers my birthday, no one wishes me for holidays.

"I hate myself so much that it spreads around me at times : Hi,

Before I begin, I am sorry for my language skills, it isn't my native tongue and I am not the best writer. This is the first time I express myself. I have nobody else but here.

  
In my country at schools retakes are once a year at the end of academic semesters where one retake can make you pass or fail the whole year. Until university I always slacked around and was practicing programming. At the end of each academic year I would attend all retakes and pass with C or above. However, we had those meetings where teachers would give feedback about us to our parents. And teachers always said ""Kuzenet is very kind and quiet. He is a nice boy, maybe the nicest in the class but he doesn't study at all."" These words would render my mother super angry. Every time she is back from those meetings I would get yelled at and my mother would cry every time. I am very sensitive and it was very damaging for me. Not to mention i did get beaten up a couple of times due to my mother's anger. My father would make his grumpy face - i would rather prefer someone torturing me instead of seeing him like that for months. He would never talk to me with a happy and welcoming tone. I could tell he wants me to go away as soon as possible his sentence is over from his tone. By the time my parents get better, another meeting would happen and all would reset. This loop begun in primary school until the end of high school.  


The reason why I mention this is because, now I feel incredibly inferior although I got scholarship and a part time engineering job. I feel very stupid at work and at university as well. Especially because the fact that I started university a lot later than my peers. I have no friends, literally zero. People only text me when they need help with assignments or when they study for exams. People I helped gave me nice feedback all the time about how their grades improved thanks to my assistance and all. No friends from that either. I pick foods that don't damage your brain but I love chocolate and every time I eat chocolate I feel very guilty thinking the sugar will dampen my cognitive abilities once sugar levels go down. All I wanted was friends that I can listen to, text with, read their messages. My phone doesn't function well for the past year and I didn't get a new one because there is no use for it in my life.  


I read a lot of suggestions online about going to rock climbing or something like that, but I am not into that and besides, I am living abroad. It is really hard to make any friends when you are a foreigner even if you are a fit in their culture just because you don't know the language that well. There is also the fact that some people don't like the country I came there from. They have assumptions about people from there and they avoid me at first. I do not put in the effort of proving them I am worth their time because I also don't think I am a great person either. I am only good at solving problems when people have one. Other than that, I don't know what to do.  


This consistent anger at myself being stupid and incompetent makes me short tempered at my parents. When I visit them I get easily annoyed. Today I made my father upset, I am very afraid of losing my parents as I think as people age they can't endure sadness or stress well and each time they are upset, I get 10x more depressed at least. My hatred towards myself is just adding up. This ends up being a infinite loop.  


I remember I was a very happy kid but nowadays nothing makes me happy. This has been going on for about 8 years. Everything is black and white. I attract no-one, I don't look into mirror for the past 8 years and I overthink everything.  


I hate myself to the fullest and I can't forgive how many times I made my parents upset. I failed a business before starting university due to third-party conditions. It wasn't my fault but still, I am the one who caused a loss. While I am not considering suicide because I can't do that to my parents, I don't feel alive at all. I live to work, yet I fail at being successful.",moderate
"I shouldn't stay : I feel so alone. I feel myself becoming bitter and hateful inside because of it. I'm starting to become racist inside, and I don't want to be. But I can't change. I am tired. But I'm not gonna become an incel. I refuse.
But I feel so hateful. I should just die. But I can't do that to my family. To my reptiles. To my uncle. I'M TRAPPED. There's no options. I'm literally a disaster waiting to happen. If everyone has an FBI agent, I hope mine snipes me down. What the hell do I do? I can't live in loneliness, but I can't die.",moderate
"Christmas Noose : Impending like a noose reliant upon the slightest pinch of gravity, Christmas came, descending the world and everything in it to the brink of the obsolete. I had just come home from being abroad for 16 months; a trip one would hope and expect to be tickled pink with engaging stories and comedy, wisdom and knowledge to be shared. but i was depleted, and the expectation of this hearty social spiel put me off ease. I had come to witness and suffer a lot about myself in the past months, a personal revelation of sorts.
and it's nothing new this sort of thing, but this time my self inflicting alienation was pushed to the brink of possibly no return.
Now factor in relationships of mixed dynamics, uncertain and weary groundings and my vulnerability to inevitable triggers, you have my worst major depression of my adult years.
Family burst through the doors as joy flooded the halls alike the day Christ walked the earth. All sin and past troubles forgiven, personal strife and habitual feuds overcome. Tensions in themselves silenced while penance was dealt and checked; for this one last Hurrah of the year, together we'll ring in the bells. The house was falling down with good vibes, positive feeling caressed past failures of what Christmas stood for any year before. It was going to be a merry Christmas for everyone, no doubt about it. Barr the one unsettled trembling in the shadow of its wake.

23rd, my brothers birthday; it was the only time I felt the fear of a real attempt. Any time previously was mere ideation or desire, the epitome of justified wallowing where i could alas drift off to sleep. I left a birthday card on my brothers bed while everyone was out; making errands, seeing friends, soaking up the immanent joys of the Christmas spirit. I was at home checking online the Hangmans knot. My wardrobe called to me sinisterly as it was just the two of us alone, it took the form of regrettable reminiscence that all these years before it stood there towering, i was oblivious to its fate. all at once so obvious but startling that thats where it will end. standing inside of it was as if it was made for me. It's size and stability; another dimension. In a way alike luxury, to go out like this. but all at once so painful that the odds were exact, it was clear more than ever i needed to get out ASAP. My dressing gown belt, soft like a teddy bear, mint green like a babies crib took on a form so ugly as it tightened itself around the wardrobes bar, securing itself so firmly, its dark potential indiscernible. As I let my weight go and blood filled up my head, it was the closest i've ever come to initiating death. As consciousness blurred and the grasp threatened control, there was indeed something putrid that the act embraced. Feelings of letting others down, as i cower and take the easy way out. The innocence of man so faraway and sweet. Who will deal with this and what kind of scar might it leave, forever taunting them unsubstantially with the horrors beneath. It wasn't right, and it wasn't the end. We take with us precisely what we leave with; The knots need to be undone first.

That night I drank wine, as i failed in feeling, thought and form. To go on as usual keeping undercover this malignant crime. 
All angles whispered deception as paranoia gurned from the cracks. I was falling away from reality and cowered under a mask. In silence and in fear, there was nothing left to say. I had killed the Christmas spirit but was around for the aftermath.  My mind looped furiously convincing the monster to die away. Such narcissism void of goodwill, urging to trade good tears for cold blood. Such a vile abomination, what a disgusting creature i've become; lurking above, friend to no one. The future had spoken and this is my fate, judgement day was here and now it's too late. Trapped in a coil, unable to liberate, the pressure was unbinding; as theres no way to turn back time.
The blackhole from where I lay reflected what I've become to this day, I woke up and prayed for night, just to hide away. Empty and alone, far away inside. Sucking soundly on destruction, damned off the face of the earth.
Life still existed, it's exuberant treasures and delight. It's infinite possibilities, its eternal flame alight. I see the potential the soul interplays. It's creative reciprocation between the parts; but in darkness and in solitude you forfeit the power to engage. This type of doom, you can't just walk out of. It's exceeds shame and guilt, with the regret and the pain it spreads. It is a malignant stain that can't be erased, the choice of sorrow against the light of day. The denial of the transitory and fighting against time. The refusal to give up the demons of the mind. The evidence was loud and clear, this karmic debt was in. I will have to work my life in defeat if I ever hope to make it back. 
There was no sound sleeping for anyone in the house; who tried their best to ignore. There is no point using words, it empowers the cause even more.

As days harshly passed, and cold winds pierced the heart. A raw and withered longing crept in once more. The Will to surrender to the hand up above, who provides tremendous shelter and pushes you forth. The memory of humour and Soloman's song, the play shall wait for you to accept your part.",moderate

"Happy New Year. : It is a new year. Everyone takes decisions to make their lives somehow better. I did not take any when the year changed. I thought I already had what made my life better. But it is gone. So I'm taking a decision too now, not to make my life better I do not want this anymore. Reddit, i wish i was not that lonely, I wish I had been less mean. Maybe I deserve all this, but I won't bear the weight of my world. I give myself until Sunday to think and then I'll depose the weight of my life and let what was left of my surroundings deal with it.",moderate
"I (16F) think i’m going to kill myself. : Everything is getting bad again, my trauma and body issues are resurfacing, my relationship is failing and it’s all my fault, i’ve lost my will to live, school is fucking awful (i’m getting bullied and the school couldn’t give less of a fuck), i’m so fucking stupid and depression is making it worse and i just don’t want to be alive anymore. 

Not even my family care about me, they wouldn’t even notice if i disappeared. My parents don’t even f*cking live with me anymore, i must of been such and awful kid that they had to get away. i mean it’s fair, it’s not like i deserve love or care. i wonder when my friends and family will notice that the suicidal jokes aren’t jokes anymore.

i hate myself so much, i keep thinking about all the dangerous situations i could put myself in that would make me suffer.

"First day of a a new year full of old shit : Ever since I was about 14 I started to realize that what I was going through wasn't normal. I was (and still am) extremely depressed, but it came in waves. I am 17 now and have tried to kill myself 6 times and ended up in the hospital 4 times. My family has in no way supported me and constantly  tries to put me down. Everytime I try to have a serious conversation with them about what is going on they blow me off and yell at me for trying to get attention.

They make me move schools about every 5-6 months or so which makes it really hard to make friends. Currently they are home schooling me which means I sit at the kitchen table in full view of everyone looking at a computer all day for about 10 hours. I cannot go outside and all social activities are banned I guess you would say. Everything in my house is under lockdown. For Christ sake they have locks on the fridge and cabinets. I have to ask for everything and most times the answer isn't just a no, it turns into a whole ass lecture.

Going into this new year I cannot think of anything good that's going for me and I genuinely feel like trash. I got a really bad 'wave'  of pure helplessness and started to cut myself, I stopped myself before it got too bad but my arm is currently fucked up again.

 I dont know what I'm doing with my life and I sure don't know what I'm doing here. I guess I'm just hoping I'm not the only one going through this.

"For the last 5 months my life has been falling apart and I'm over it... : My girlfriend gave birth to my son 7 months ago. At the time we both agreed we would stay at her parents for a few weeks for a little extra help. A month goes by of myself going back and forth from her parents to our apartment I figure I'm wasting a lot of gas and time so we talk and she is not ready to leave. I understand but I also dont want to burden her family so I go home to our apartment and stay thinking she is going to be home in a week or so. Another month goes by and she does not want to come home. She says it for the convenience of being at her moms. So now I'm home alone and I miss my family. After a couple more months of arguing over her not being home our relationship has gotten weak and distant but we have a routine now and I am asked to watch my son while she works sundays. I have been paying the rent on my own now because she says she makes no money at work. I struggled with that bad.Around the same time my work van with all my tools get stolen, my livelihood. Shortly after I am had a scare that involves my blood pressure but at the time I was scared. I was at work and started getting dizzy, my eyes turned into static and I blacked out. Finally she speaks up and tells me she loves me but is not in love with me anymore. She is not coming back. So now I feel pathetic because I am moving out of our apartment because I do not need this space and cant afford it by myself. I am begging for her to try for our family.
I have been at a really bad low since she first decided not to come home. On top of this I am dealing with the financial stress of the apartment and having to buy a new van new tools a deposit on a room for rent a storage unit ,etc. I drive on the freeway and notice every gap in the railing I can drive off of . I dont want to be without my family i dont want to force someone to be with me as well. I'm tired of being home crying but I cant go anywhere I'm to down I cant eat I lost 35 pounds in 3-4 months.

"Anti depressants killing sex drive? : Basically my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago was diagnosed with depression.

Im trying my best to be there for her as much as possible, doing what I can to reassure her and just generally be there for her. 

Anyway, to the title... me and my girlfriend have gone from having the most amazing sex life to it being non existent this past couple of weeks, of course sex isn’t at the fore front of her mind and that makes sense... however, something she said last night got me thinking “Is this normal” . We tried getting it on, and she said she wanted too but she felt guilty, as if she wanted to have sex with me but when we got close she felt a sense of guilt like she shouldn’t and we just sort of stopped. Is this normal?",moderate
"An hour into 2020 and I had already slipped back into self harming. : Multiple trips to the psych ward during 2019 after suicide attempts, and now this (and I drunk called my brother).
Fuck this year is already starting bad. I'm not sure if I'll make it to 2021.",severe
"😐 : i feel like im locked in myself, anger and rage making every day unbearable. not to be psychotic or anything, but i would very much like to murder all my loved ones indiscriminately.  the moral side of me (the coward) says no, stops me from doing any harm to others and myself, but everytime one mentions any sort of negative feelings and those suicidal thoughts, i want to kill them. let me do it for them. let me fucking bash your head in you little shit i cant bear to see you suffer like this. i could easily kill myself, but the survivalist wont let me. the need to see these people flourish despite theur difficulties is what prevents me from doing. contradictory to this, i would very much like to get rid of then along with every single human being on this planet. i want to be alone. i want to be unique. i want to ravage this earth on my own and live the beastly horrid life i deserve to live. kill me like a wild animal. The only difference is that i'll be filled with sin. 
😘✌lol ahaha sorry about that. i hope you have a nice day, lovelies 💗💗 sorry for the odd vibe haha",moderate
I’ve reached a new low : I spent the New Years Eve Countdown alone. I had planned to kill myself 16 minutes ago but I was worried my dog would be scared alone. All I want right now is just to be held and told everything will be okay.,moderate
"27M all my friends, peers are moving with their lives, i feel like i'm stuck in a rut going nowhere. : **I'm a 27M , no job no gf zero friends, no social life, totally loser,** i have tried everything to get a job, get a gf but getting rejecting from both, therefore i have no social life, no friends no money and no reason to go outside the house, while all my friends getting promotions, getting beautiful girlfriends and cars, all i have to do is stay in my room and scroll facebook and instagram, which makes me more depressing. They all have great lives while i have zero social life, and they go along with their age, right things at right age, while i have no clue why nothing works for me. Today is 2020 January 1st, first day of the decade, and i woke up with zero notifications zero new year wishes tho i stay on social media 24\*7. I'm at that point i dont hate my life now, im slowly hoping it would be end soon, as i can't bear this loneliness and hopelessness and defeat anymore. I'm not envy with others lives, but i don't know why nothing works for me. Just don't tell me go out and make it happen i have tried for both jobs and girls, getting rejected from every interview and not even get a dm back from any girl. And its eating me alive i'm running out of time... i know im lost, but i don't know why this shit happen only to me.  


i don't have any social skills to make friends or to get a gf. i'm not an interesting person, just a pale skinny guy with a feminine face, so the girls reject me at the first glance, i'm not very good with sports music and anything particular girls find attractive, all i do is sit in my room and watch movies. i'm tired of these things bothering me, im really love if my life end now, i mean i don't want to things get better or worse, i'm sick of this being a someone who is not good at any thing or not special to anyone",moderate

"Why the fuck did I make it past 2020? : I dont know if I just like to be constantly suffering or something. But I cannot comprehend why I'm still breathing. I guess I could say I pussied out and didn't kill myself already. But idk, probably. I've already been on this fucking planet for over a decade and a half, I've already seen theres no fucking point in any of us. We just killed everything we touch. And soon the whole fucking world is going to die.

It doesnt fucking help that I'm contributing zilch to society. ""Oh, you're still a teenager, you're still developing."" 

Yeah, you mean the 5 year long plateau in every single fucking thing I try. Or how I've literally started to slur and stutter with my sentences, meshing them into one blob of a sound. Or how about my drawing capabilities dipping in quality, now being about as good as a kindergarteners art project. If that isnt digression in development then idk what the fuck is.

I'm literally becoming worse and worse by the day, my mental state is like a fucking volcano ready to explode, my body seems to be slowing down and feeling more and more groggy, I've been getting more and more sick, my bones are starting to ache, my skills in art is diminished, my speech is going to shit, my social skills have always been shitty and piss poor.

And now my depression or whatever the fuck it is, is apart of me.

It's who I am, a negative and vile piece of trash, I CANT EVEN FUCKING EMOTE ANYMORE. MY BODY FEELS LIKE AN EMPTY SHELL.

why cant someone else just fucking kill me

If my mind and my body keep on going like this, then I'm going to kill myself before I graduate

Because the world doesnt need someone who cant even fucking achieve mediocre things.

I should move aside for the actual fucking important people to help the world",moderate
"I think i’m going to kill myself : everything is getting bad again, my trauma and body issues are resurfacing, my relationship is failing and it’s all my fault, i’ve lost my will to live, school is fucking awful (i’m getting bullied and the school couldn’t give less of a fuck), i’m so fucking stupid and depression is making it worse and i just don’t want to be alive anymore.

But i can’t kill myself yet, i don’t want anyone to miss me",severe

"show of hands, or am i the only one : i write suicide letters every single day. i tend to store them in my wallet/notebooks/underneath mattress etc. only issue is that i can’t kill myself due to people caring which i hate. why care for a worthless individual who’s given up. care for people who have their shit together. just stop caring, let me go. because i already have.",moderate
"Forever Lost : (22F) I’ve had severe depression since I was 14 and going into 2020 I’ve just been hit with a massive wave of overwhelming dread. 

I quit my perfectly ‘good’ job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that’s for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn’t doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it’s like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to “figure it out” while going back home for the holidays.

But now I’m just, lost. I’ve been lost since I was 14 and I don’t know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I’ve never felt like I’ve belonged here, like this life isn’t for me. I can’t fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ‘normal’ life. 

I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.
Now I’m so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don’t feel a passion or drive to do anything. 

In some ways I’ve grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I’m the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. 

I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it’s just... “eh”. 

I don’t have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer’s run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I’m losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it’s like extreme brain fog that I don’t know how to get rid of.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I just need to let it out somewhere.

I’ve never posted before but this subreddit makes me feel some sort of comfort that I’m not alone in this. Thanks if you made it this far.

Love to all of you. ❤️",moderate
