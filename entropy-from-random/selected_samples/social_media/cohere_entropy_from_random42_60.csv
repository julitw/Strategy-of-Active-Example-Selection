"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate

"(23F) Separated from husband with 50/50 custody of 2 year old : I suffered pretty bad from PPD after having my son. It didn’t help that my husband was toxic and had his own problems. Now we’re on better terms but separated and he’s paying for me to live in my own 3 bedroom house, for the sake of it feeling like another home for my stepkids. Totally love that it’s awesome. But 95% of the time it’s me and half of the week it’s my son and I. I’ve been eating right and exercising daily for the past month and a half, feeling so good about myself. Yesterday I got my son back and was so happy. I meal prepped in the kitchen with fun music while simultaneously playing with my kiddo. A really amazing day. Well today I could hardly get out of bed when he woke up at 5. Obviously that’s wayyyyy too early for anyone so I just put it off as being tired. But then I noticed a pattern. When he’s here, he wakes up early, we have way too much screen time in the morning because for three hours I physically cannot get out of bed (for anything for myself but I’ll grab him his breakfast/snacks/diaper and we will just be in bed). Then I just feel like I can’t do anything. Dishes?? No fucking way!! I haven’t done laundry in forever, and my house after three months still isn’t fully furnished. I type that and think I’m just lazy. But holy hell, I took my son to the museum today and that was the biggest feat I think I’ve ever pulled. Just making that move to get out of bed, get myself dressed, get him dressed, leave the house... now I feel so heavy. My head actually feels pressure pushing me down. I don’t want to do anything. I had a three day streak where I didn’t brush my teeth or my hair, and that’s still while dieting and exercising. I think I am always depressed, but on some days I can do more things than others and distract myself. 
Anyway. Meeting my STB ex tonight with my stepkids for a show. Another thing that I have to force myself to do without thinking of vomiting.",severe
"3 weeks on mirtazapine 7.5 mg pros, cons and questions. : I was prescribed this medication for depression and anxiety. 

Pros
1. It has helped with the intrusive and existential thoughts. I don’t spend hours stuck in a loops of bad thoughts anymore. 
It has helped me fall to sleep quicker. 

Cons
1. My appetite was not the best before the medication but I was able to maintain weight. After taking it I have gained over 20 pounds in only almost 3 weeks. In 2017 I lost over 70 pounds in 3 month span from stomach issues (gastroparesis and IBS and stomach ulcers). I went from 205 to 135 dangerously fast almost needed a feeding tube. I used weed to cope with the nausea and appetite problems before this medication. It later was a factor in my depression sadly. 

2. Even though it helps me sleep, I wake up at 11 am after sleeping close to 12 hours exhausted. I still feel the sedating affects from the medication. 

3. Still hasn’t changed my dull emotions or lack of emotions. I still can’t genuinely laugh or smile (even while smoking weed). It just feels weird like I am in a haze. 

4. My short term memory has gotten way worse while Taking the medication. I always have had a minor short term memory problem when I started smoking (go figure). Now after not smoking for a whole month I was diagnosed with a inattentive attention disorder. I almost feel like I am not Perceiving time normally. Days months and years go by to fast and have been for the past 3 years or so (I’m only 19).  I can’t focus on anything and I stare off into space a lot. Which causes anxiety about my mind spiraling into the concept of time and how fast everything goes. I also have zero thoughts at all it’s weird like it’s hard for me to think of something. 

5. It hasn’t helped my anxiety at all. I still have social anxiety and fluctuations in heat rate which gets me more anxious because I have Bradycardia (35bpm for me normally). 

6. I can hardly work out on this medication. I have no energy and get burnt out easy. post workout I could almost fall asleep. 


I would like to know if anyone has had similar medication experiences? And does anything actually change? I don’t want to waste anymore of my life in a hole. I also don’t want to waste time with a doctor giving me a cocktail of medications to make me feel like a total zombie. I’m only 3 weeks on meds but I have spend the last 3 years digging myself a hole with abusing cannabis. I also don’t know wtf I want to do with my life. I am in fear of working for “the man” to make his pockets bigger while I am just skimming by, clutching on the 2 days of freedom every week. I rather be in the mountains in a cabin fishing and going skiing. Honestly my depression stems from having the 1st taste of what the majority of people’s “real world” is like.",moderate
"Triggers : So, this may get removed like some of my other posts have been, but we'll see.

I am doing better than I have been in the past, but there are still things that trigger my dark spiral. I recognise the feeling inside when it gets triggered, that weight of dark thought that suddenly starts building. That voice that starts pushing pushing pushing me to do something that I know I shouldn't.

So I do little things to appease that voice.

Deleting characters in games I play. Deleting posts that caused the trigger in the first place.

It's worst when all i was trying to do was share something, trying to empathise, trying to grow, but to get slapped down, to be rejected... hurts and that hurt triggers the darkness.

I'm trying my best, but it gets fucking harsh when all I seem to get is slapped down.

No, that's not right.

No, you don't get to say that.

No, you don't matter.

It's worse when I'm alone at night. There's no one here to turn to. I am, and I always will be, alone.",moderate

I want everyone to forget about my existence (26m) : So I'm going through my dark times for like the millionth time where I just shut down and cut communications with everyone I know. I used to be so social but I cant even trust my own shadow anymore. I've deleted all of my social media for months now and I just dont wanna deal with the world you know?

"I can’t be happy the same time as everyone else around me : It started off as a stupid theory. But over time believe it or not I have statistical data proving how insane the dynamic of my happiness compared to those around me is.

Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It’s uncanny.

The latest example would be the past year I’ve spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. 

October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I’ve been stripped of everything good in my life....

....and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It’s almost as though I’m the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It’s happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. 

It’s one thing never being happy. It’s another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I’m almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time. 

Assuming these aren’t thoughts of a madman and it’s factual, what would you do? Would you sacrifice your immediate happiness in order to watch everyone you love be happy? Or are you fine with watching your own people suffer while you enjoy life? 

I’ve been depressed most of my life. And for once I don’t want to get better. Because it just doesn’t make sense to be happy if everyone else around me isn’t.",moderate

"Missing work : This is the third day off I've had from work since starting a little over a month ago, tomorrow will be the fourth. I only work three days a week (12hr shifts) so each day off is a big deal.

I'm scared about not making enough money, getting in trouble at work, or even losing my job. I just don't feel like I can do anything. I've always struggled with work and depression, the anxiety of knowing I have a responsibility, knowing I have to go somewhere and do things, be around other people all day etc. It's too much. It feels like I'll never be able to just work and function like a person, live a life. Everything is too much and all I want to do is sleep.

"The trials : Hey. New to this community. But not really new to depression. I have been medicated a while and recently made the choice to try and handle life myself. 

Dont get me wrong. Im in a great place in life right now. I have an amazing boyfriend. My job is.... relatively great. I cant complain.

The thing is, though... my demons still haunt me. I have a not-so-great family. That is my biggest hill to climb and always has been. I hate getting like this because I get so irritable and snap at my boyfriend. Any little thing triggers me and turns me into this hateful person. Don’t get me wrong, I’m hurting. Im not a bad person but its easier to destroy relationships than build them, right? I think thats a common in this community. 

My other biggest vice is dependency. Right now the withdrawals from my medication are bringing me down, even though weed and nicotine help. Unfortunately, weed is hard to come by in my situation and the nicotine helps until I overdue it and feel terrible. Then when I run out of weed its like nothing is good and I hate everything. Maybe its just the dependency, and I know some of you may feel that drugs are terrible, but it helps. Because in this situation even a moment of relief is worth it, right? Sadly, I know sedation is only a temporary (and non-sustainable) solution. But it helps, right? 

I like smoking because it takes a whole cloud of thoughts, worries, and troubles to a minimum. It takes all the extra stuff away and at that point, its just me. 

I was the, hands down, happiest in my life when I was physically fit. I was serious about fitness and eating right at one time and thats something I want to get back from. But how do you make that step? I weigh the most I ever have, and also feel the worst. I know the solution, but actually doing it is so hard. Its so hard to focus on something when you are wearing a mask. Constantly focusing on keeping thoughts at bay is exhausting and all that I want to do is relax. 

Im sorry for the read. I know my first post is just a jumbled rant, but I wanted to give this community a try. Because even though I am terrible about giving the community I have IRL a chance, community is all we have, right? 

Best Wishes,
Elijah.",moderate
"It's NYE and I was rushed home by my narcissistic mom. Sometimes I wish I really wasn't here : I felt so positice today. Looking forward to the new year. Now I'm on the toilet with anxiety and diarrhea because my mom causes me so much stress. I was hoping tonight would go well too. I went to my fiancees house to visit with his mom and dad for a few hours. I told my mom I would be home by 8. I talked to her on the phone while I was there and told her more like 730. Honestly I had forgotten about that and left at 8. Before I even got out of the cul-de-sac she's blasting my phone with a call, yelling at me, "" where are you it's after 8!"" While it is literally 8:03 mind you. When we get to my house I break down crying. She tells me the usual. I'm sorry, I love you, I didn't mean to make you cry."" I try to explain that just because you stab someone doesn't mean you want them dead. It's the same logic. She says then that what about the times when I do things to her and she has to accept my apologies? Like, I'm your fucking daughter, wtf.

But just this past week, my ex started having conversation with me while we were packing so we could move out before the first (today). I knew we had to communicate but we didn’t have to joke around, update each other, and just interact the way we did. it was completely shocking, and i didn’t think it’d effect me so much, but it did. i love him so much, and talking to him like old times made me so incredibly happy but now i’m a mess. i feel like I’ve lost all the progress i made. he left on the morning of new year’s eve without saying goodbye. i went to work right after he left and figured he’d be home by the time i was out. but nope, he was gone, he changed his number too so when i tried to call him about some stuff he had left behind, i couldn’t reach him. this was all a big shock to me, i rang in the new year confused and in tears frantically packing and moving everything to my parents’. 
i don’t know what to do. i feel terrible, i feel like i’m slipping back to feeling the way i did before. i think him interacting with me the way he did made me feel like he wanted to try to be friends, i don’t know. i wish he had just left me alone if he had planned on leaving so abruptly.",moderate

"What is enjoyment? : I can't remember the last time I enjoyed something. I use to enjoy my job, use to love learning new stuff everyday about it. I use to love gaming, built my PC and everything, played overwatch and CS:GO religiously. I use to be one of those people who truly believed the world was your oyster and if you tried you could have anything. I use to do practical things every weekend like work on my car ect.

I hate work. Thinking about it makes me so mad I can't sleep when it's late. Gaming is now used to simply pass the time until it's late enough to sleep, there is no joy from it anymore. Infact I see it as a waste of time as I'm not bettering myself... Yet I no longer do stuff to better myself anyways? Study things? Don't do it. Gym? Nope. Learn something new? Can't be bothered. Where had my motivation gone, my discipline, my joy from literally anything in my life? I don't look forward to anything. Haven't in weeks, months even. I'm so glad when my monday-friday work week is over, to then notice I can't feel enjoyment and the weekend will be pure depression, and I must desperately find something to occupy myself with... Usually that's sleeping and hoping I can sleep longer than usual, ready for the monday-friday work torture again.

"NYE depression - Bad english warning, just wanted to get my thoughs out : 01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont 

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what? 

&amp;#x200B;

I

DON'T

KNOW

&amp;#x200B;

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my 

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

&amp;#x200B;

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know, 

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

"What the hell is wrong with me / I need help... :  
I just moved into my first apartment ""of my own"" at 33 (almost 35 years old) - granted it's ""section-8"" housing paid for largely if not mostly by the state specifically for people w/ disabilities - but that's beside the point...) ***ANYWAY***, I've got a big problem and I don't know how to get over it.
I should point out that I've probably posted here before in preparation for this move (it took 5 months between signing the lease and actually moving in and starting to live here - so bear with me if any of this sounds familiar.....if that bothers you, just please ignore it and move on rather than bothering me with ""trolling"".
Sorry, I got a bit off topic there for a minute. My problem is that I basically just sit in my apartment all day watching T.V. or playing games. I've met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when I first moved in (just to introduce myself and ""say hi"" - which took a LOT of courage for me as I've got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone.
At any rate, so far I've met (or at least casually said ""hi"" and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a ""handful"" of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program I'm signed up for or in the hallways. But I frankly can't find pretty much anyone I want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. There was one guy that I liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted (and that's coming from an ""uber-introvert"" LOL) or something like that - he didn't even want to offer up his name.
Having said that, here's my real problem (and likely the point where you all start to ""hate"" me lol/smh):
1. I'm admittedly somewhat ""bigoted"" if you will against PwD (""persons w/ disabilities"" for those unfamiliar with the acronym). A ""self-hating PwD"", if you will. It's NOT that I find anything inherently ""wrong"" or ""bad"" with PwD, so much as it is I'm so fucking god-damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing BUT a PwD, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another, because ""normal"" (for lack of a better, more ""P.C."" term) society doesn't want anything to do with us and ""God forbid"" they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us.
2. I will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually (***significantly***) ""below my level"" OR they have some sort of speech impediment (probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain's ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, I'm not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry) - neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it DOES severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. I quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who doesn't have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with ""kitties"" (true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats) or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. That's like ***WELL*** over 50% of the people I've come across so far. And the ones who aren't impaired in those ways that I've met so far, are either significantly older than me (this apartment's average age I'd say is well over 50+ and I'm not yet 34) or we just have nothing in common as I'm obsessed with sports and movies and T.V. and I have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. (NOTE: Sorry I should've tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but couldn't figure out a good way to do so).
Now, mind you - I know damn well that my inherent biases and SUPER anti-social tendencies are playing a (big?) part here, but I just can't bring myself to find anybody here who I want to get to know or hang out with. For that matter, none of the people I ***have*** introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say ""hi"" in passing me in the hallways.
I've thought about trying to find a way to ""get involved"" in the community *outside* of the building, but between my ""anti-social"" tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far, the other problem I have with it, is there is basically only about a 3-hour window - maximum - that I want to fill during the **daytime** hours (roughly 12-ish to 4:45-ish, my shows start at 5:00).....including transportation, which having to rely on ""para-transit"", means I could spend most of that time waiting).
And even that time I could probably spend catching up with shows I've missed that I want to see on demand. Basically, as has been the case for as long as I can remember, I'm a T.V. (and computer) ADDICT - and I'm largely okay with it, except I know it's unhealthy and antisocial. Ideally, I'd LIKE to be more social, but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly I don't seem to *want* to get to know (and they've certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we don't have much in common, and she's already admitted that I'm a ""dick"" - which I already knew so I wasn't offended, the idea is less than appetizing. (NOTE: thankfully, she doesn't seem to mind that I'm a dick, but again we only ate lunch together one time and I never got her apartment number and I haven't seen her since).
So to make a long story short - how do I get over my fears, and out of my funk, while still maintaining the things I enjoy (like surfing the net and binge-ing on T.V.) ? I'm thinking about volunteering, but the last time I tried (before I moved) I seem to remember those places always want you to volunteer - understandably, for a lot more hours than I'm willing to commit to.
I'll end by saying (if anyone is even stil reading this ""TL;DR"" post at this point,) that there is no need to point out any sort of ""self-sabotaging"" or ""excuse making"" on my point. I'm well aware I do ALL of that, and I just can't get past it....in which case I'm afraid I'm screwed until I'm able to do so.",moderate
"I came to the conclusion that I'm dead inside. : Welp, to summarize the story, it's happening a party right now, I see people happy, dancing, enjoying the moment, you know? But I can't. I'm surrounded by happiness but not able to feel it. It's like I am a dead man which breaths.

My brain is dead and I am tired.

Happy New Year.",moderate

"Do you just get unreasonably angry sometimes? : And what do you do to calm down?
I'm just angry. Nothing really happened. I was just having minor issues with an app. It took maybe 5 minutes to resolve. Why am I so pissed?
It's not a new thing or anything. I tend to be really angry when I'm not doing well. I'm not sad or anything, just angry. I feel like I'm snapping at people a lot as well too.
I just want to leave and never come back. I want to just leave everything behind and see where I end up. I don't really know what to do.",not depression
Life is so fucking cruel : ,severe
"meh : i wish i didnt see reality as it is. i wish i had some goals to achieve, some sort of purpose, happiness would be cool too. instead im always by myself 24/7 even if im with other people, and thats it. it makes me sad, that a decade has passed. life goes by so quick its insane

 i don't wanna feel happy at this point, so no meds for me. reality sucks, and i just have to get used to facing it everyday. i question if this reality isn't hell, because sometimes it feels like life is just out to get me. i sometimes worry about going to hell, but what if this is hell? 

the funny thing is that i dont mean jack shit. theres 7 billion people here. not to mention in the observable universe i am literally just a speck. however my brain doesn't see it like this. life is a huge mind-fuck. x  10000000000000000000",moderate
"not felt like this since i got off meds 2 years ago : im really struggling atm my relationship of 5 years is going badly, work isn't going great and i cant push myself to do any of my hobbies don't really know what to do or where to start i just need help. 
i haven't had this overwhelming sense of apathy since i got off citalopram 2 years ago. i cant really describe how i feel its like i dont feel anything but im know im unhappy. never really opened to reddit like this before and im not really that good at explaining my depression... never have been.
what do i do?",moderate
