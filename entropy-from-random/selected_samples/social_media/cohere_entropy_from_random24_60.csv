"üòê : i feel like im locked in myself, anger and rage making every day unbearable. not to be psychotic or anything, but i would very much like to murder all my loved ones indiscriminately.  the moral side of me (the coward) says no, stops me from doing any harm to others and myself, but everytime one mentions any sort of negative feelings and those suicidal thoughts, i want to kill them. let me do it for them. let me fucking bash your head in you little shit i cant bear to see you suffer like this. i could easily kill myself, but the survivalist wont let me. the need to see these people flourish despite theur difficulties is what prevents me from doing. contradictory to this, i would very much like to get rid of then along with every single human being on this planet. i want to be alone. i want to be unique. i want to ravage this earth on my own and live the beastly horrid life i deserve to live. kill me like a wild animal.

"My meds aren‚Äôt making my depression any better as of late. I don‚Äôt know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorder

Currently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn‚Äôt enough, so I take three 5mg pills. 

Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn‚Äôt leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I‚Äôm married and have an actual career. 

Problems are the following:

- I am apathetic AF. I‚Äôm a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can‚Äôt go out and do social things. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I‚Äôm not enjoying all the things I love. 

- I‚Äôve gained about 40lbs and I‚Äôm tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. 

-  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. 

I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. 

I don‚Äôt have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",severe

"The trials : Hey. New to this community. But not really new to depression. I have been medicated a while and recently made the choice to try and handle life myself. 

Dont get me wrong. Im in a great place in life right now. I have an amazing boyfriend. My job is.... relatively great. I cant complain.

The thing is, though... my demons still haunt me. I have a not-so-great family. That is my biggest hill to climb and always has been. I hate getting like this because I get so irritable and snap at my boyfriend. Any little thing triggers me and turns me into this hateful person. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm hurting. Im not a bad person but its easier to destroy relationships than build them, right? I think thats a common in this community. 

My other biggest vice is dependency. Right now the withdrawals from my medication are bringing me down, even though weed and nicotine help. Unfortunately, weed is hard to come by in my situation and the nicotine helps until I overdue it and feel terrible. Then when I run out of weed its like nothing is good and I hate everything. Maybe its just the dependency, and I know some of you may feel that drugs are terrible, but it helps. Because in this situation even a moment of relief is worth it, right? Sadly, I know sedation is only a temporary (and non-sustainable) solution. But it helps, right? 

I like smoking because it takes a whole cloud of thoughts, worries, and troubles to a minimum. It takes all the extra stuff away and at that point, its just me. 

I was the, hands down, happiest in my life when I was physically fit. I was serious about fitness and eating right at one time and thats something I want to get back from. But how do you make that step? I weigh the most I ever have, and also feel the worst. I know the solution, but actually doing it is so hard. Its so hard to focus on something when you are wearing a mask. Constantly focusing on keeping thoughts at bay is exhausting and all that I want to do is relax. 

Im sorry for the read. I know my first post is just a jumbled rant, but I wanted to give this community a try. Because even though I am terrible about giving the community I have IRL a chance, community is all we have, right? 

Best Wishes,
Elijah.",moderate

To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure.

So don‚Äôt fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.

I‚Äôve been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. 

But that‚Äôs ok, because it doesn‚Äôt matter, nothing matters after all. Don‚Äôt take life too serious, it‚Äôs a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it‚Äôs okay, because you‚Äôre being loved.

"3 weeks on mirtazapine 7.5 mg pros, cons and questions. : I was prescribed this medication for depression and anxiety. 

Pros
1. It has helped with the intrusive and existential thoughts. I don‚Äôt spend hours stuck in a loops of bad thoughts anymore. 
It has helped me fall to sleep quicker. 

Cons
1. My appetite was not the best before the medication but I was able to maintain weight. After taking it I have gained over 20 pounds in only almost 3 weeks. In 2017 I lost over 70 pounds in 3 month span from stomach issues (gastroparesis and IBS and stomach ulcers). I went from 205 to 135 dangerously fast almost needed a feeding tube. I used weed to cope with the nausea and appetite problems before this medication. It later was a factor in my depression sadly. 

2. Even though it helps me sleep, I wake up at 11 am after sleeping close to 12 hours exhausted. I still feel the sedating affects from the medication. 

3. Still hasn‚Äôt changed my dull emotions or lack of emotions. I still can‚Äôt genuinely laugh or smile (even while smoking weed). It just feels weird like I am in a haze. 

4. My short term memory has gotten way worse while Taking the medication. I always have had a minor short term memory problem when I started smoking (go figure). Now after not smoking for a whole month I was diagnosed with a inattentive attention disorder. I almost feel like I am not Perceiving time normally. Days months and years go by to fast and have been for the past 3 years or so (I‚Äôm only 19).  I can‚Äôt focus on anything and I stare off into space a lot. Which causes anxiety about my mind spiraling into the concept of time and how fast everything goes. I also have zero thoughts at all it‚Äôs weird like it‚Äôs hard for me to think of something. 

5. It hasn‚Äôt helped my anxiety at all. I still have social anxiety and fluctuations in heat rate which gets me more anxious because I have Bradycardia (35bpm for me normally). 

6. I can hardly work out on this medication. I have no energy and get burnt out easy. post workout I could almost fall asleep. 


I would like to know if anyone has had similar medication experiences? And does anything actually change? I don‚Äôt want to waste anymore of my life in a hole. I also don‚Äôt want to waste time with a doctor giving me a cocktail of medications to make me feel like a total zombie.

"I don't know how to deal with any of this, I need a second opinion : The beginning of the year always sucks. Nothing ever changes, I'm just going to tell all. I need someone else's point of view on this

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to deal with my situation. Even though I get good grades and all, I have been seriously considering dropping school and work for a semester and just leaving, and just going where I want to go for a change. I want a new experience. I want to get away from all this shit.

Today, my mother says she's emotional - I ask her why, but I already know what its going to be about. About my grandparents and how much they miss me. A year ago I fell out with them, because I told my father about something that happened to me when I was young, four or five years old. 

My grandfather and I played a ""game"" once where we put our hands down each other's pants. We would also go skinny dipping in the pool a lot. I went through my early childhood thinking that this was normal behavior. I don't know if it's fucked me up psychologically or not but going into my teenage years it was always a passing thought and something that bothered me from time to time as I grew to understand that that shit was inappropriate.

My father is a bipolar alcoholic and he lost it. Threatening to kill my grandfather, etc. Drunk calling them and telling them he was coming over. It was a mess. He reacted like a child and there was no way to put him on a leash. 

Anyways, every month or so for the past year my mother would bring it up to me even though I don't want anything to do with it. She is devastated that her parents and I no longer have a relationship. Quite honestly I couldn't care less if I don't have a relationship with her father seeing as he put his hands down my pants when I was four years old. But she just doesn't understand. She cries and cries and tells me they love me and that they miss me and that this is just such a pain for her and them to go through. She asks me if I really believe he meant to hurt me. I feel horrible and sometimes I regret ever saying anything.

Maybe I'm the one in the wrong? I don't know. This is why I'm posting this, I need a second opinion. A lot of times I feel like a self-centered bastard because I can't just man up and pretend like nothing happened. But at the same time I will never be comfortable around my grandparents ever again. At the same time I don't think I will ever think or feel normal ever again. I have no one to talk to about this, I have no close friends anymore and I don't want something like this to affect people's opinion of me.",moderate

"I can hide everything except my scent : I go to work feeling gross. My armpits are always smelly. I have tried to shower daily, wear deodorant and cologne but I just... don't do anything about it.
It weights me so much yet I can't get a hold of myself.
I am disgusting, I can go weeks without showering or brushing my teeth. 
It is very obvious that my friends, family and coworkers realise that I stink and they are becoming increasingly passive aggressive about it.
It all makes me so sad...",not depression

"I had a panic attack trying to do my favorite hobby.. : I don‚Äôt know why it happened and I‚Äôm still freaked out and scared..I‚Äôm an artist I like to draw cartoon animals and animate too. I‚Äôve always been into cartoons and animation when I was a kid and I‚Äôm 17 and still watch cartoons. But I‚Äôve been so depressed lately it feels like my mind is numb I haven‚Äôt drawn in weeks lately..and I know I should do it again so I don‚Äôt you know forget how to draw lol. Tonight I got a comment on my (old) YouTube speedpaint video it‚Äôs been a while since anyone has commented I haven‚Äôt uploaded in a few years because of my condition. It read ‚Äúare you alive?‚Äù And i was worried and also happy that someone still cared and I thought maybe I‚Äôll get my tablet out and draw again. But once I got it out and started drawing the sketch I felt my chest getting tight and it was so hard to breath..and the more I continued to draw it got even tired and I felt a panic! I stopped and threw my tablet on my bed away from me and stopped. I was breathing heavily and my head felt weird at the same time. I had a damn panic attack! I was so scared my worst fear has happened and I can‚Äôt draw! If I keep getting a panic attack every time I draw I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to enjoy anything..!! I still can‚Äôt calm down and it‚Äôs very hard to whenever I see a drawing or try to draw myself I feel a panic attack coming on..

I feel like I got like this because I couldn‚Äôt feel anything. Usually when I draw It feels nice and enjoyable bring my dream characters to life on paper or digital especially when animating. But it‚Äôs been so long since I felt happy that I can‚Äôt even be happy trying to draw I don‚Äôt know if that makes any sense but I‚Äôm freaking out! I‚Äôve been depressed for way to long and I need help but my parents don‚Äôt believe I have depression even when I told them I had suicidal thoughts. It got worse to the point that feel like I should kill myself..no matter how many times I tell my parents I don‚Äôt think they understand how bad this really is...this is really bad..I need help and soon because I don‚Äôt know what to do..",moderate
"What is there? 2020 is just a number I have to endure until I give up : It‚Äôs not new, it‚Äôs just a day, I can‚Äôt feel awake or connected to the world 80% of the time.

I was going to go away this year, I thought the summer was the beginning to my life, but it was a dream- and I destroyed it;

Recap of my year:

Left an ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling for 2 years of my life.

Met an amazing person who I broke up with and caused him more pain being with me- still can‚Äôt let go and I feel like a creep (still ‚Äúfriends‚Äù)- still held on a ‚Äústring‚Äù but he doesn‚Äôt seem to care even though he says he does- I drive him away

Lost 4 jobs due to depression and anxiety

In a lot of debt now due to not working
Started smoking cigs/vaping A LOT

Abusing my adhd meds to feel some sort of motivation

Taking SSRIs prescribed to me- feeling completely numb

And on top of it all: a good friend (both moved to different cities a year ago) is not in the psychiatric ward of a hospital- she had a gun to kill herself- was abusing medications and completely delusional/disconnected from reality. Speaking to her on the phone (delusional/she would hang up) and hearing the entire story from her sister, broke me completely.

Now I feel crazy. I want to die, and there‚Äôs nothing here for me.",severe
"Empty : What do you do when you can literally see yourself going in a downward spiral but you have no motivation to buckle up? I feel so empty , like the batteries in my brain are dead &amp; the store bought (anti depressants) are yunno not cutting it. I just want to live a normal life without this illness. Its taken so many years of my life i cant get back &amp; i dont want it to take more than it has but damn its so freaking hard sometimes...",moderate
"Anyone else find that they are unable to cry? : I've been depressed for about fifteen years and when I think about it, I don't think I've cried for the last seven or so. It doesn't happen and I can't get it to. I feel like there's something wrong that this ability or natural reaction is gone for me. Maybe it would be helpful or cathartic to let things out, but I'm unable to get myself to cry. 

My depression mostly feels like nothingness instead of sadness, but there's a lot of sadness I think I need to feel to get over things, but it's like I can't make myself experience these emotions.

Is there any way to get back this ability or these feelings? I take medications and see a therapist and psychiatrist, but they haven't helped in enabling me to experience emotions or be able to cry.",moderate
