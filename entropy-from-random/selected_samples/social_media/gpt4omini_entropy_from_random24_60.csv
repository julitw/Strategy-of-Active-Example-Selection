"Getting help or realizing your not able to do it yourself.. : Getting help for depression is good but why can't we just do it ourselves and no, I'm not one of those people who tell you to snap out of it I'm just saying when someone is depressed they might wonder to themselves why they can't just do it without help. Getting advice from a therapist is good, but having to ask for help because it's gotten too far might make others feel useless without other people and I'm really confused because I don't know what's best for anything anymore.

"A New year a new me (long) : I have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last New Years, but I didn‚Äôt, the reason is I had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver, you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning. While still being at my worst at this point I made changes to improve myself, I lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times I took weed edibles etc. I did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss. I know I didn‚Äôt push myself to my full potential, I messed days up, and I mean that‚Äôs fine but I got off track and into a depressive state after those days, every New Years I reevaluate my life, to be or not to be, and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether I want to approach the next year at all. This year I‚Äôm cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where I push myself harder than I ever have to see if I can do it and whether there‚Äôs something out there worth it for me. I am going to give myself the best fighting chance I can. 

It‚Äôs easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it, and don‚Äôt get me wrong It‚Äôs hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head. 
But...I personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad. If we don‚Äôt fight what‚Äôs the fucking point right?

I read a post I think on here where they named their depression frank... I mean it‚Äôs also known as monkey brain. This has helped me quite a bit over the past year But yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank, say hi frank you can piss off now. Or swiper no swiping lol (Dora depressed lol) but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank. From there I like to torture frank, franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night. The way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domain(you). flex your arm right now, it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control, remember that, if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will (https://youtu.be/--j5sGlrqMk) you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him, and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank, cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive, if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing, rejuvenated and alive( if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart, shits a god damn drug to me,it hypes me the fuck up.) torture methods also include exercise, have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chest/neck, hell no. 

I am personally going to challenge many things I have already been doing and some I have been slacking on and new challenges.
My list includes; 
4:30 am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of 7 am, 
No masturbation for the whole year, its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit. You will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time. Anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year. 
cold showers
exercise/train hard with a program( up to you) and only 2 days off for recovery at max. Get light body weight/cardio on these days. 
half hour+of meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed. 
2 day bulking fasting routine(snake diet)(side note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts, I‚Äôve lost over 100lbs on it, just do it, it will make your life so much easier and better. It changes your mindset, if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline, what‚Äôs stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort, which leads me to this post and my new years resolution)
Beyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion, dry year.
learn guitar and master 12 songs at least(singing too). 
Improve the workload I can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects. 
Get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so I‚Äôm not stressing out.
Naturally these habits will replace filler activities/bad habits/depressive habits like gaming/Netflix/getting high/staying in bed from 5pm to bedtime stuck in your head, for hours on end. I have pretty much cut all of these out, I need to work on YouTube a little still, I have already cut down my subscriptions to people I actually watch and enjoy and that might only be 2 to 3 videos a day I watch. Maybe one for you is social media addiction, I don‚Äôt use social, get off that shit, that ding notification dopamine hit you get, oh who texted me etc. What did this person post, why am I not getting likes on this post etc. Also if you post god damn everything you do online, there is nothing to talk about with another person for example. Ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them. 

I know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that, but this is where I call home for the past few years, I just wanted to share my guidelines I will follow for the year to decide it all. I know I am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post, Or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way. I‚Äôm tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if I just outthink frank that everything will be better, you can‚Äôt outthink feelings. it‚Äôs time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better. 

If anyone would like to join me this year on some challenges maybe we can have a thread dedicated to people who want to fight their depression to death. I‚Äôm tired of feeling and living this way and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one.",moderate
"Thinking about becoming a mod : I've come to the realization lately that even though I constantly put myself out there, I'll always just be eclipsed by people more interesting than me. My name is Adam, and I'm pretty sure my best friends have  referred to Adam Sandler more in the past month than to me. I know that's kind of a shitty way to gauge my relevance, but I think it puts my situation in terms others can understand.

With all this, Reddit's been feeling pretty good the past month. I know its not much, but getting a few people upvoting and commenting whenever I post just feels right. Its the little things that count, and I wouldn't have that many social interactions if I didn't install this app.

On top of that, my sisters were getting attention from different people all week. Again, I know how ridiculous I must sound typing this as a *guy*.

"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even. Whatever the case set a task for yourself you kind of feel accomplished in a way. I just kind of wanted to put my thoughts out there venting also helps obviously lol",moderate

"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate

"Best antidepressant for major depressive disorder? : I‚Äôm currently on Adderall 30 mg twice a day and have been since 2014.

I have tried Wellbutrin, but its too much with the Adderall.",severe
"I said I wanted to be alive for 2020 : It‚Äôs stupid. it‚Äôs so small. my mom won‚Äôt even remember it but I will. she asked how my NYE was and if I was still alive after the partying. Without thinking, I said yes, and that intended to be for all of 2020 

my mother, who has taken me to the hospital 5 times for suicide attempts started bawling. She said that was the first time in 10 entire ass years that I said i wanted and intended to be alive. 

I‚Äôm crying. It‚Äôs sad. It‚Äôs kinda beautiful. It‚Äôs mostly sad. I love you mom",moderate
"Getting help or realizing your not able to do it yourself.. : Getting help for depression is good but why can't we just do it ourselves and no, I'm not one of those people who tell you to snap out of it I'm just saying when someone is depressed they might wonder to themselves why they can't just do it without help. Getting advice from a therapist is good, but having to ask for help because it's gotten too far might make others feel useless without other people and I'm really confused because I don't know what's best for anything anymore. This didn't make sense to most but for you who did understand, thank you? xD",moderate

"Hit Me Up : Hey y‚Äôall, I understand that for many of us, the holidays are the worst time of the year. Many of you feel alone, many of you feel that nobody understands you.

I‚Äôve overcome much of my own depression. Obviously, I haven‚Äôt cured it, but I‚Äôm surviving; and that‚Äôs the next step on the way to living. 

I‚Äôm about to go to sleep. Hit me up with a chat or DM, and I‚Äôll get back to you when I wake up. I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel alone tomorrow. Goodnight my friends.",not depression
"Happy new year... : I started 2020 be sending my friends a text just saying 'Happy New Year' and one of them responded with ""are you drunk or high, you seem to always do that on new years"" Thanks dude, thanks, i mean it sorta sums up my life, drunk or high",not depression
"Im depressed, sorry to tell you : Im only 16 about to be 17 so what ever. I have had depression for a few years now (I've lost track) and always end up fooling my counselors and my family because I always feel like I have nothing to complain about because people always have it worse than me. I have a good life; roof over my head, family, not a lot of frends but what ever. And so now i dont have anybody to tell about this becaues i am afraid they will find out i am depressed so i kinda push them away. Also i dont even know who is reading this but i am sorry for porring my problems on you.


Ps. Grammar and on mobile.",moderate
"It's NYE and I was rushed home by my narcissistic mom. Sometimes I wish I really wasn't here : I felt so positice today. Looking forward to the new year. Now I'm on the toilet with anxiety and diarrhea because my mom causes me so much stress. I was hoping tonight would go well too. I went to my fiancees house to visit with his mom and dad for a few hours. I told my mom I would be home by 8. I talked to her on the phone while I was there and told her more like 730. Honestly I had forgotten about that and left at 8. Before I even got out of the cul-de-sac she's blasting my phone with a call, yelling at me, "" where are you it's after 8!"" While it is literally 8:03 mind you. When we get to my house I break down crying. She tells me the usual. I'm sorry, I love you, I didn't mean to make you cry."" I try to explain that just because you stab someone doesn't mean you want them dead. It's the same logic. She says then that what about the times when I do things to her and she has to accept my apologies? Like, I'm your fucking daughter, wtf. 
Anyway I'm just so fed up with everyone. I feel so depressed when I'm home. When I'm with my fiancee I feel better. And honestly, I feel like I have diarrhea from all this stress. Fuck this.",moderate
"Too hard to ask for help : Title says it all. I need help with things in life at the moment but have never been good at asking for help. I am more of the suffer in silence and not dump it in others. 

I have a great but stressful job, and it takes up most of my time. I am not dating anyone and have given up on that. I live alone and when I am not working, I am at home being a homebody.  I know I have dealt with depression for years, so on days I am off, I tend to sleep the day away. I moved to a new city a year ago, and like with me previous move, I am just at the point in life where it takes too much energy to attempt friendships. 

My biggest issue right now is the state of my living space. I can't be bothered to clean or don't care? I am unsure. I want to hire someone to help me clean on a regular basis, but I am ashamed to have someone see how bad things have gotten.  I think a better living environment would help but again i am overwhelmed. Should i just bite the bullet and not worry about them judging me?  I know i will not be able to do it myself so i am just trying to be realistic. I just have hidden this so well from others, i dont know if I can handle being judged on my mess.  It's not hoarder level but it makes me anxious none the less. 

Any tips or advice.",moderate
"2020 is in less than 2 hours and I don't feel ready : Everything is against me, especially during these holidays. My friends, my family, myself are all fucking me up deeply. 2019 was not a good year for me. How am I supposed to survive 2020 when theres no one left to help me?",moderate
"I think one of the most powerful things about depression : is that I really really want help, but for the life of me I can't make myself actually buckle down and actually source a good psych and go through that entire process. I hate feeling so empty, hopeless, and unwanted but everytime I say to myself ""ok, I am going to do it this time. I am going to go over to my computer, look up psychs that take my insurance and make an appointment"" I just go well... maybe tomorrow. The thing about tomorrow is that it never comes.",moderate
"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even. Whatever the case set a task for yourself you kind of feel accomplished in a way. I just kind of wanted to put my thoughts out there venting also helps obviously lol",moderate

"Realised how ugly I must be. : I'm a guy... but it still hurts a lot. This week spent with family during Christmas and New Years has completely hammered home the fact that I'm ugly. Or, the ugly one in the family. And extended family.

I know I've always looked terrible in photos, but just seeing me in a bunch of them alongside my siblings and cousins this week, and seeing people on Facebook commenting about and complimenting them but ignoring my presence... it hurts, even though they didn't even say anything. It's just that I definitely know I don't look good, and it feels like everyone else is smart enough to know it too, which makes me shrink into my chair even more.

On top of that, my sisters were getting attention from different people all week. Again, I know how ridiculous I must sound typing this as a *guy*. But I already feel invisible and worthless enough as is in my life... and this week couldn't have made me feel anymore unwanted and alone, from family, friends and strangers alike.",moderate
"It doesn't feel right : I used to be depressed. I made a few posts on my main account but now I'm too scared of someone finding me through it so now I have this one.
Point is, I think I'm more than just sad everyday but I don't want to worry anyone so I make bad jokes every now and then. I like to pretend that I'm confident and have pretty good self-esteem but lately I've been realizing now much of a lie that is. I really do think I'm worthless, ugly, stupid...All of the things I know I shouldn't be calling myself. It just feels so much easier when you're the one insulting yourself because at least you know it's true.
I don't care when others try to help. I've heard it all before and it only makes me want to shut myself off even more from them. I appreciate everything everyone's ever done for me but can I just be sad in peace? I'm terrified of being depressed again. Those years were horrible and I don't think I can go through it again. I'm fine with being alone with my thoughts but I'm scared of saying too much and making someone worry. I'm starting to realize that I'm sad everyday and I don't know what to do.
That's why I'm here again. I want to talk with others who get it. I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to. It's reassuring knowing that the other person feels somewhat the same way.",moderate
I don‚Äôt know what to do : I feel like there‚Äôs no one I could talk to. I don‚Äôt want to go to a hospital or something but I feel if I actually told someone how I was feeling for what I thought they would try to send me to some place like that. I just feel so fucking alone.,moderate
"I think I forgot how to exist : I‚Äôm just here. It‚Äôs Christmas, which normally I LOVE. I love snow, I love lights and all the weather, but I‚Äôve felt so completely empty the past two months. I can feel my life moving and I feel like I‚Äôm not even seeing or feeling any of it. I‚Äôm just going through all the motions, and I‚Äôm starting to panic a bit because everybody is acting like this is completely normal. Like I keep telling them something is very wrong with me right now and no one believes me or sees anything wrong. I‚Äôm scared because I feel so disconnected from everything I used to love, including the people around me. I‚Äôm really stressed about it and I am not sure how to help this. I tried to get an appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist, but they couldn‚Äôt get me in until February. My counselor is overbooked because it‚Äôs at the university and she is always swamped. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",moderate
