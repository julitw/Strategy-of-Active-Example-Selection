Yayyyy [NAME]!!!! Now go get a hat trick tonight!,excitement
People still expecting that are delusional regardless tbh. Messed up they'll never say what happened to Half Life but time to start using some context clues herr,realization
Happy B'day for Thursday!,excitement
“We only let him jump around for 12 hours a day!” Wow. I’m so sorry this is happening to you.,remorse
"Oooooffff. That's real awkward, but I mean that somehow still ended better than I expected so.. Kudos ig??",embarrassment
Has it really been 10 years since brown saved the world. Now I feel old.,neutral
I read the Wikipedia and I’m even more confused now.,confusion
"I feel bad for them now, but if they ever get good I’ll hate them like the rest. ",disappointment
Idiots gonna idiot.,anger
"Her upper lip always looks terrible - such an easy fix, can’t believe she is so vain and never bothers to wax ",embarrassment
You did the right thing. You’re not ready to settle down so you stopped wasting her time.,approval
I dunno...it was used for a meme and it's very fun to look at,amusement
I think it was roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct for the chirp or something stupid like that. I couldn't believe [NAME] got away with that,annoyance
I buy and sell iPhones and January has been slow for me too. Good luck to all of us.,optimism
Ladies and Gentlemen........We got him,joy
i actually didnt know that there are people out there using quotation marks for emphasis until that weird [NAME] song,confusion
I need like a drawn out visual or something,desire
"Since I was a kid I knew I preferred funny, smart, interesting girls to conventionally attractive ones. Really tore me up the feeling wasn't mutual.",sadness
I’m curious as to how this came about in badwomensanatomy. Was she saying this was something that couldn’t be done?,curiosity
"Takes a lot less effort to just say “fuck off, buy your own.”",approval
I really wanted this to be a real sub.,desire
"[NAME] looks too creepy,but it's a very nice drawing.",fear
"Me too! And he was so happy to get that out of her back, he seems like he really cares.",joy
Wow I didn't know it changed your face so it doesn't break rule 1 and 2? /s,surprise
I think the book portrayal is more ambiguous than you say. I like that the show leans into one interpretation of her character instead of keeping it vague.,admiration
"Ah, my bad. Always mix em up. Thanks for the correction!",gratitude
Thank you so much! This summarizes a lot!,gratitude
"""UGH FEMINISM!!! SURELY THATS THE REASON I CANT GET LAID!!!"" see you in hell ",anger
Feeling better now?,caring
[NAME] damn I love Coops,love
[NAME] deserves to play for a proper club ffs.,admiration
"Oh, sorry bud. Didnt mean to be rude",sadness
"Time consuming too, but buying a box that size outright is stupidly expensive—even if you order a bundle of 25 at a time.",disapproval
I think the [NAME] biscuit joke takes the cake,amusement
Oh hi there stereotypical psycho right-wing tabloid sound bite.,neutral
I love how the girl on her phone in the background sees what happened but just doesn’t care...must happen all the time.,love
Can’t be worse than last week,disgust
"And it should be drenched in blood. It’s supposed to be scary, that’s how you know [NAME] loves you!",realization
"Keep your head straight, stay on your path, and stick to your guns. ",caring
What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(,disgust
I’m sorry. It was nothing to be angry about,disappointment
Dude couldn’t see he had a spool of hair growing on his face?!,surprise
"not really. I worked hard to live there, and it was different then. Far cheaper. ",disapproval
Danggit. Im mad i didn't think of that,annoyance
"Sorry, I meant let them know outside of class.",remorse
Is she worse than [NAME] though?,curiosity
"THERE'S A WAR COMING, NED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'LL BE FIGHTING...BUT IT'S COMING!",fear
I hope Thier friends now,optimism
