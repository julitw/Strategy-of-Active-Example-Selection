Family & Relationships,"Title: Is a man with an master's level degree and 1 million dollars more or less attractive than one with good looks?, Content: What traits do women find attractive? Does the amount of money or the education a man has completed make any difference in a decision to pursue a relationship? What about power? What about personality? How much does physical attraction play in the decision?, Answer: DEFINTELY, women will always seek a man with money, power of fame, than a man who is good looking, they prefer it all, but may not get it all, after all they want a certain level of lifestyle. The hotter the women, the more she KNOWS she can get in terms of financial security, that is her cash trade value, if she is less attractive, she must either get a degree and earn more money, or marry whomever she can be with. Men marry what they can afford, if you are plumber, you are not going to be getting the Pam Anderson's of the world, but if you are rich or famous ( or both ) then any hot women will be wanting for you.\n\nWomen who say money does not matter are more than likely not a 9 ro 10, but a 4 to 5, they know their place on the ladder rung of life."
Business & Finance,"Title: we are paying mortgage on a empty house that is for sale is there a better solution?, Content: paying mortgage and renting an apt due to pending divoice is there a better way to handle this until the house is sold renting  is not an option, Answer: Time for getting past what caused the split and figure out how between the 2 of you to get the best value from the situation.\n\nFirst if you can, you need to lower your price.  \n\nNow use the kids ballpark divvy system.  Remember when you were a kid and had to share a candy bar with a friend.  One of you would break the candy bar in half and offer the choice to the other person as to which half they wanted.  Simple but fair and very effective.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is that you agree between yourselves that one of you will make an offer to move into the house until it sells and makes some sort of payment as rent.  Now that might be the whole payment or a partial payment, either way it should be better off than each of you paying half of the payment on a vacant house.  So the agreement is made and the offer is made, now the other person (not making the offer) has the choice of either moving back in or letting the offeror move back in.\n\nIf moving back in isn't an option for one or both of you get creative and work out some other sort of arrangement.\n\nGood luck"

Science & Mathematics,"Title: How can I conduct an experiment to show the possibility of stopping global warming?, Content: , Answer: First you have to define what causes global warming.  then you need to decide what of these variable are dependant or independant.  You could then chose one of the independend variables and try to design an experiment that shows how varying that variable causes a change in warming.  an example might be saying that CO2 causes global warming by increasing the insulating value of the atmosphere, you could then set up an experiment where an environment(a large sealed environment(5 gallon glass jug)  is set up to permit differnet concentrations of CO2.  Add a radiating heat source like a heat lamp and heat the closed environment,  measure the inside of the environment and then turn off the light.  graph how long it takes for the environment to return to ambiant tempeture.  increase the CO2 concentration and try it again.   It might be too difficult, but it shows the scientific process.  and you should get some good graph points."

Politics & Government,"Title: Court ruling...?, Content: I went to court to battle an uncooperative ex-wife over unpaid medical bills for my son. The judge ordered her to pay me the FULL balance. The bills are in collections but it get's very confusing because they are my sons bills, but under my name. The judge said we can take care of it any way I want meaning she can send me the check or send it directly to the collections agency. I want it sent directly to me so I can make sure it gets paid, she hadn't paid this bill for over 2 years, why would I trust her? Now she says to me to give her copies of the bills so she can review them. Is she too late for this? It's already court ordered for her to pay it. I have already done enough leg work getting balances and calling and fighting with collection agencies because she wouldn't cooperate. Do i have to provide her anything now that its court ordered and been through court? She is threatening a De novo hearing., Answer: She is in contempt of court.  At this point, its not her concern what the bills are and for how much.  She doesn't need to see them.  The court ordered her to pay them and that's all she needs to know.  I'd advise the court that she is in default and request another hearing."
