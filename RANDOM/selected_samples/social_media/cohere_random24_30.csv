a never ending nightmare part 2 :  you know it is hard giving it your all when everyone around you wants you to fail even yourself and when you look at what is coming next you really dont find it all that fufiling or worth the time or the expense and when everyone fills your head with this idea that your a failiure you start slowly but surely get to a point where you get tired you cant do anything all hope is lost and you really stop caring hell even stop fealing empathy in some situations it is really a very cruel life to live but i keep going on not out of any desire to succeced and trust me there no benifit in perserving but just so i could watch everyone suffer and fall in to the firey bottomless pit of hell or in an unhealthy hope that maybe just maybe someone will realise the wrongs they do not just to me but to others as well get hit by the fact that there are consequences to there actions but i know it is not gonna happen even if time itself ends it is not going to happen and that why it is an unhealthy hope and it keeps me awake at night wondering why dont i just make them pay for there actions or just kill myself and see how big of a pretanious jerk everyone can be aw well i guess that that is all there is in this universe for me,not depression
"What it do, why is this. : So I’ve grown up with parents who were not a good pair. They fought a lot and screamed at each other my whole growing up. It came to the point my mom would leave tinge house and my dad wouldn’t let her. I would have to follow them outside and force my dad to stop holding the car door on my mom. Pulling him off with all my muscle. He stepped on my toe and broke it at some point. Now whenever someone gets really mad and yells at someone else, mostly crying yelling. I get very anxious and uncomfortable . Sometimes get nauseous. Why is that, is it kinda like ptsd to some of that or what. It doesn’t affect me that bad and no one has noticed so it doesn’t affect me too bad. Thanks ✌🏼",severe

"I've decided to be celibate and kill myself. : I don't want to live, I hate life, but I have dreams, pipe dream they might be, but fucking still.

I'm about to turn 18 and my plan is to give life my best shot and try to live to the fullest until I'm 25, then I'll be hanging myself, its long enough to spare me of my suffering but also enough to experience life, if it truly does have something to offer.

The reason for celibacy is fairly obvious, If I'll be dead by 25 so It would be cruel to fall in love and break a girl like that, I simply despise casual sex, so thats off the table as well.

"Just so exhausted : No matter how much or the right amount of sleep I get I'm so exhausted, I thought maybe it was exhausting me keeping all my emotions bottled up and not crying when I felt like crying (cause I was at work and then at a NYE party) and when I found the time I let myself cry and feel everything and now I'm even more exhausted than I was before.

I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

Sorry for this rant, sorry if some things didn't make sense, but I had to take it out of me or I would've crossed a line.",severe
"I feel like a ghost... : I feel like nobody would really miss me if a suddenly dropped dead. Everywhere I go I wonder if I’d really be missed if I died. I’m a senior in high school and it feels like most of the time I don’t even exist. When I go to school nobody ever greets me or wants to have a conversation with me. 

I’m ignored by everyone even people I’d call my friends. I can’t help but feeling worthless, that people I’ve known for years won’t even talk to me. It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with. The kind of people you hang out with all the time and are totally comfortable with.

I just needed to vent, I don’t know about the rules on the sub but I just needed to get that out.",severe
"Smart guy with a lot of dumb questions : I've really been struggling to post this, since I've always struggled to show any of my feelings towards everyone I know and even towards myself, but here we finally go.
I'm a 22 year-old medical student from Europe, 3.5 years into the studies, everything going well so far, passing all tests without even attending the lectures and starting to study few weeks prior to the test phase. Aside of that everything else has also always been going well for me, safe neighborhood, caring parents, good sportsman, nice friends.
But now it is that I just seem to have lost interest in everything I once loved over the past year or so. Maybe in life in general, since I don't see any sense in this life anymore. I know many people feel like this, but somehow they seem to find answers that keep them going. To me there is no answer to this question, that makes at least any sense. Some people want to be remembered, some want to achieve something for themselves, some don't want to think about these questions. I want absolutely nothing. Everything that I thought I wanted over the past few years only made me fun for a short time. Even when I have a good time going out with friends or so, that just vanishes, when I start to ask myself these questions and can't find an appropriate answer. 
So the best thing I've found to do since this started, is rapidly increase my weed consumption. I've been smoking for quite a few years, but it's gotten a little excessive the last year. I still mind to get my shit done, so I only start after I've finished what I had to do for the day. Then I roll a few fat ones and just try to make my  brain not think about those questions till I fall asleep. I've already thought about this causing all those problems in the first place, so I stopped smoking for 2.5 months last year and it didn't really affect my situation at all. I started again because I think it's just better to not think, than think of questions you can't find an answer to and that stop you from moving on.
That worked well for quite a time, but lately the quetions just keep getting more and more and I seem to find less and less answers. Why did I choose to study medicin in the first place? How could I think this would be fun for so long, even though it's just smashing facts in your brain, so that you can't possibly remember them?
But what hits me by far the most is this: Who the fuck am I even? I feel like what made me finish school without ever trying to ask these questions, is that my father would always have a talk with me when I got a C or worse. This didn't happen really often, but I remember feeling very bad after that for quite a time. I think that's why I still just keep going without even knowing why, I just couldn't stand disappointing him and my mother. So did I make this decision or was it the way society viewed me and I then thought I had to live up to? How can I go on without knowing this? How do I find the answers?
There's a lot more questions I struggle answering, but I don't wanna write too much, I doubt anyone's gonna make it until here anyway. If you read this and proved me wrong, thank you.",not depression

"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression

"I totally lost it at the very beggining of 2020 :  

01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know,

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Anyway I started new year/decade with the right move, didn't I?

Joking...

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate
