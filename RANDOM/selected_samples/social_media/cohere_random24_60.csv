"2020 is gonna kick my ass : if I don’t end it all this year it will be a miracle. I’ve already spiraled for the past 6 months and I don’t know what the FUCK TO DO. my mom has terminal pancreatic cancer and she’s been diagnosed for 4 months. The average time from diagnosis to passing away is usually 3-6 months and 8-12 months with good treatment. If she dies this year idk how I won’t kill my self or give up on everything. I’m graduating high school this year and I’m worried I’m going to end up hanging from a noose or strung out on every drug I can get my hands on. I’m a 17, almost 18 year old girl I should be hanging out with friends and partying like I did when I was 16. Instead I cried in front of my parents 30 minutes after watching the ball drop in New York. I started this decade off crying and with zero sleep.",moderate

Making the choice : Sometimes depression really is just a big game and it is all about mentality. It is so hard to make the decision to not give up and to not talk down to yourself. Sometimes i make the choice that I am going to start taking care of myself because I deserve to feel good an healthy but it is so hard to stay in that mindset and so easy to stay unmotivated and just want to fall deeper and deeper into depression. Sometimes I decide i’m not going to care about trying to be happy and I am going to push everyone away to protect myself and because my mind likes to tell me no one cares when people really do. I decide i am not going to talk to anyone and should just accept my suffering and bask in it. It is so easy to not want to do anything to feel better but there is other options and it begins with making the choice to care about myself,not depression

"(23F) Separated from husband with 50/50 custody of 2 year old : I suffered pretty bad from PPD after having my son. It didn’t help that my husband was toxic and had his own problems. Now we’re on better terms but separated and he’s paying for me to live in my own 3 bedroom house, for the sake of it feeling like another home for my stepkids. Totally love that it’s awesome. But 95% of the time it’s me and half of the week it’s my son and I. I’ve been eating right and exercising daily for the past month and a half, feeling so good about myself. Yesterday I got my son back and was so happy. I meal prepped in the kitchen with fun music while simultaneously playing with my kiddo. A really amazing day. Well today I could hardly get out of bed when he woke up at 5. Obviously that’s wayyyyy too early for anyone so I just put it off as being tired. But then I noticed a pattern. When he’s here, he wakes up early, we have way too much screen time in the morning because for three hours I physically cannot get out of bed (for anything for myself but I’ll grab him his breakfast/snacks/diaper and we will just be in bed). Then I just feel like I can’t do anything. Dishes?? No fucking way!! I haven’t done laundry in forever, and my house after three months still isn’t fully furnished. I type that and think I’m just lazy. But holy hell, I took my son to the museum today and that was the biggest feat I think I’ve ever pulled. Just making that move to get out of bed, get myself dressed, get him dressed, leave the house... now I feel so heavy. My head actually feels pressure pushing me down. I don’t want to do anything. I had a three day streak where I didn’t brush my teeth or my hair, and that’s still while dieting and exercising. I think I am always depressed, but on some days I can do more things than others and distract myself. 
Anyway. Meeting my STB ex tonight with my stepkids for a show. Another thing that I have to force myself to do without thinking of vomiting.",severe

"Help. : I'm 24 and I'm useless, I have studies in programming and sadly had been fairly smart through my life, but it does not even matter. It's only make my family expect me to be great which I never had any idea how to be. Right now I feel I'm unbelievably stupid. I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. 

All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.

They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.

I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. 

I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.

"i was recently diagnosed with depression : Hello, as my titled says, I was recently diagnosed with depression. I don’t know where else to tell my story but I feel like I need to do it to prevent myself from doing something bad. I’m 18, I live in France and i’ve started going to college in September. Since then, I was feeling really off, as if I was some kind of second character in other people’s lives, but also in my own. I was feeling really lonely, but seeing my other friends feeling the same way reassured me in this feeling. However, as the time went by, I saw those same people gradually becoming better while I wasn’t, and I started losing contact with them. I used to be really friendly, always laughing and going out, while being really dedicated to my studies. Since then, it’s just as if everything just started becoming black. I’ve lost interest in going out, making jokes and laughing didn’t light the same sparkle in me, studying made me feel dumb and empty. I constantly feel like i’ve chosen the wrong path, but feel like i’m not good enough for another one, and i always wanted to come back to my parents but i wasn’t feeling right in my place anywhere. It started to became more and more frequent, with thoughts of quitting everything, or that I didn’t belong anywhere, etc. I didn’t want to go out anymore, or when I did, I just needed to drink to feel in a right headspace, or else I just felt as if I was standing aside of my own body, not knowing how to act or what to say to make believe that I was doing okay when really I wasn’t. I started to see my college’s psychologist but he really didn’t help me and instead made me feel really weird about myself and the way I felt. I spoke about it to my mother, which wasn’t that concerned because I hadn’t told her yet that I was thinking a lot about death and suicide. She helped me find a psychologist, which I started to see every week, since february. She immediately told me that she thought I had depression and needed to take medicine, and so I had to go see a psychiatrist to get them. With my psychologist, we talk a lot about my life in the past and how I could see the world as another point of view, and she makes me think of a lot of things about me, but really she just points out a lot of things that i do or am that kind of make me sad about myself. What really scared me is that I usually enjoyed a lot going to concerts, which made me really happy and the last two i went to made me feel so much anxiety and discomfort that I had to go out before the end. I was really disappointed towards myself. By then, I tried going to several places to find a psychiatrist but no one helped me or took me seriously and I felt like I would never be helped, and I felt like I didn’t really want to on the inside. I wrote a suicide note, and I was ready to try to kill me. My boyfriend saw it and he prevented my mother, which came by me crying saying she didn’t know I had the intention to do it. We went to a hospital to seek medical help but there were a lot of kids who were really sick and I didn’t feel at the right place at all. We finally found a psychiatrist, which diagnosed me with depression, and anxiety. She gave me meds that I have to take daily and are supposed to make me feel happy again. I hate it because everytime I want to swallow the entire pack, whether it is to die or get better quicker. I started questioning myself if I had always been depressed. I’ve always felt as if I wasn’t part of this world in some way, or that I didn’t deserve to be here.
Now, i’m not better at all but I like writing down my feelings. I’m living normally and i’m trying to do stuff to keep me occupied but i’m always bored because I always want to do something but I never know what; I’m vainly angry at people that love me because they love me; when i cross a crosswalk I always think of a car hitting me and then of me suffering; I always want to sleep to forget that im alive; When I laugh I feel like I shouldn’t be doing it; I feel like i’m not really depressed because my problems aren’t important; I feel like i’m useless and that I’ll never be important to anyone; I feel like my life is pointless and that it’ll never change; I feel like I should always excuse myself because I’m not a good person; I feel like the ugliest person in the world; and sometimes I just burst into tears because it is just too much and the weight is too heavy and I want to take it off. 
That’s my story dealing with depression. Everyday I wake up knowing that one day I’ll take my life away, but I want to get better; because people get hurt because of me. I’m hurting them because I deeply hate myself and I’m constantly fighting against myself. 
I hope i’ll get better.",severe

"If you want Happiness so soon and so bad, you'll end up miserable...and depressed too : The title may sound harsh, and maybe this is not the exactly right sub to talk about this (if it isn't the post will get removed)

But I want to share this with you


A new decade started, and Day one I'm already in anxiety and I already had a panick attack...why does this matter? Well I wanted to start it in a good way...in a nice way, but I've already got a (burocreautic, yeah, but kinda big and could cost my career) problem...like every time in the last Decade

In the last Decade, I always tried hard to make everything perfect...I never accepted that I had sad moments, that I felt depression at the worst times, that some people abbandoned me, that most of my plans NEVER EVER Worked out...I mean I accepted it some times after, but I spent weeks feeling bad because...I wanted happiness, I didn't want to feel that way, I didn't want things to go so wrong and loose time of my life, suffering in my late teens while everyone was smiling...I didn't want to feel that darkness nor to be in it

I didn't accept it, and not letting go soon of this hurted me even more, to the point of making me empty so many times...I didn't felt anything anymore as I was scared to

They tell you ""Things will work out, it will go better than you expected"" or ""after the worst moments, the sun starts to shine""

But I always had low expectations, and most times, I was right to, but still...I wanted to be fine, I wanted the happiness that other people had, that I always considered luckier than me...why was I the one feeling like that?

And I got plenty of darker times after other already dark times

Scared, scarred and destroyed...and the worst is probably yet to come (being broke, parent's death, my bad state of mind getting worse to the point of no return)

The point is that...If you're looking forward to happiness so much (like every human being does and has the right too) and don't have it, you'll feel even more frustrated...so frustrated you'll end up numb

That's something we all know right? Yeah pretty much...but we don't realize that often

When we still aren't mentally ill, but we're not exactly ok either, We need to be happy so bad, just like when a kid wants a toy and the parent isn't gonna buy it...isn't it better to give up and accept they won't have the toy instead of fighting and crying?...things are not gonna change after all, the parent won't buy it

But the kid MAY have that toy one day if he/she behaves well...the kid will have the toy if there will be ""hard work"" for it

The kid will have the toy eventually, but not now, or not now by his/her parents at least

But if the kid just thinks about of not having it, this will eventually lead the kid to give up on that toy forever


You gotta accept you're ""miserable"" now

You gotta accept that life has been unfair

You gotta accept that you should've done smth more

You gotta accept that that was all what you could've done

You gott accept that things are like this

You gotta accept that even if you are a beautiful person, the best things didn't happen to people like you (right now...)

But do not search for a light that doesn't shine, because it won't shine just because you want it to...too brutal? (sorry if it is)

Isn't it better to be in the dark, alas, used to it, and then seeing a light shining, glowing and glowing more? Just be sure to still walk in the dark tho...and if you can't (and there's nothing wrong with it), please, find someone that can take you by the hand

Sadness and Pain search for you...the more you try to run away from them, the more they'll overwhelm you for good


Happiness doesn't...we have to search for it, but we gotta have lots of patience, like all good reasearchers...small steps

I wish for all of you, expecially the ones in a very dark place, Reading this now, a wonderful decade and to find the happiness and the same exact dreams you had and maybe you lost now...I can't tell you when you'll find them, and of course there will be pain and sadness before and even after that...but I hope you truly find them...I hope your suffering ends, hopefully, not by death

Life sucks, I know, I wish bad things didn't happen...I wish I didn't feel like this (it's not just the burecrautic problem...there's more)...But it is like this now and sometimes...and we gotta accept it...we gotta accept we feel bad, we gotta acept we need help too to feel good...


I KNOW THAT this is NOT the main cause for depression...I'm here talking this ""nonsense"" while some of you are deep down in despair and don't believe in happiness anymore...but sometimes, trying to feel happy, to want to be happy, when you just can't or are unable too...will badly affect people that aren't depressed yet

I know that this message won't change much...but I still wish the best for all of you again...whatever the future holds for you...it won't be just this horrible ""feeling"" (if we could even call it like that)",moderate

Example
• I got into my dream school but withdrew because I got diagnosed with epilepsy the day before going. Every since I’ve been on multiple medications known to cause depression (currently on Klonopin and Briviact daily) Only a hand full of medications work for my type and they all cause depression.
• I got a car in 2018 and haven’t driven it because I keep having seizures right before I get cleared to drive again
• My SO and I opened a restaurant but he works all day everyday and I only see him at work where we constantly rub against each other. It seems he could live with or without me and either way he’d be fine. I feel so emotionally distant from him but our relationship feels like it comes 2nd to the business.
• I genuinely have no friends. Like absolutely nobody outside of my immediate family or SO. I cannot recall the last time I hung out with a friend. It’s got to be at least 4 or 5 years ago...
I just feel stagnant... my life feels like a blur. I’ve had anxiety since 6th grade. Everyday I get anxiety episodes (like a cold rush, an out or body euphoria, sinking feeling etc) and it’s become so normal to me, nobody knows...it happens. I just don’t say anything. Yet I have great things in my life, but this sadness feels like it’s covering my eyes to al of that. Right now I feel dead and worthless inside. When I tried to tell my SO that I don’t feel very important to him he says I treat him like crap but it’s fine and made it all about my faults... I feel like a piece of garbage.",severe

Im an eighteen year old who struggles with a circuit board of mental issues.

When i was little, i wanted to grow up to be an animator, i loved watching shows and drawing, i found most of my creative output came in drawing. 


Last week, my portfolio was rejected. 
I had spent months, almost a year on my portfolio. Drawing, scrapping, crying, tearing, repeat. 
I had taken a few months to gather money for college, and i havent had the heart to tell my mom i didnt get in. 
I havent told my mom things in a long time, and i lie to her about my mental health. The amount of times ive held a knife and contemplated just slitting my throat open or holding all my night medication and downing it in one go before going to sleep shocks me sometimes. 
Its almost a daily thing, an hourly thing. With every action i do i think of a way to off myself on the spot. 

And the only thing keeping me from doing it is the time i told my dad i was having suicidal thoughts, and he broke down crying saying he is afraid to come home one day from work to find his youngest daughter dead. 
And that he couldve been home to prevent it.

And when in 2013, when my cousins died in a plane crash, my mom was devastated, she wouldnt stop crying, my dad had to restrain her, and i just started crying because i was so confused. Those are her niece and nephew but what about her Daughter? 
I may not get along with my mom, but i still love her too much to put her through that pain.

But as time has gone on I've realized she was much more mine than I hers. I've struggled with depression since I was 6 years old and thoughts of suicide since 11, I'm 28 now and through all these years my mom has been there for me.

This last year I got my heart broken, lost pets, my job but she was always there for me throughout. Ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay, that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right.

I wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren, buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden. I wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but I failed that.

I took my time, telling myself there was plenty and I'd do it all some day.

My mom died three weeks ago. There was no hints or build up, she was healthy one day and then I woke up into a dream I couldn't fall asleep in. My family is small, group of friends even smaller. As the days passed I took note of how many left my sphere, close friends I was there for are nowhere to be found.

I lost religion a long time ago, I don't pray. But I prayed in that hospital, the hours waiting outside during surgery. I promised I'd be better, I promised I'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days. I cried and begged and pleaded.

I’m a senior in high school and it feels like most of the time I don’t even exist. When I go to school nobody ever greets me or wants to have a conversation with me. 

I’m ignored by everyone even people I’d call my friends. I can’t help but feeling worthless, that people I’ve known for years won’t even talk to me. It feels like nothing ever changes too, I go to school, come home and that’s it. I don’t even care about popularity or anything like that I just want a couple friends I could be really close with. The kind of people you hang out with all the time and are totally comfortable with.

Just the thought of doing that another year actually kills me inside. I called the suicide lifeline twice yesterday and they helped me... it’s just like I don’t get the point.",moderate

"I totally lost it at the very beggining of 2020 :  

01.01.2020 3:54 am

I feel so fucking hopeless, so emptiness inside me and I really dont

fucking know anymore how to deal with it...

I am 16 (4 months from my 17th birthdays) and I've never had a love (actually

I've a crush, but like 1 year and some months, It wouldn't work between us, plus

I' am not psychically and mentally prepared for that, look at me lmao),

best friend, or somebody that could really understand me, kindred souls,

I don't know... Everything I've ever wanted is... I don't even know anymore

what I wan't because it seems that I want only things that are unachievable,

at least for me how it looks... I will never experience childhood best friend ship,

trouble with hairs, because otherwise I'm not kid anymore, more like half-adult in

this point of view.

In the moment when I thought that people don't take me as te last choice, I was wrong...

Or wasn't I? When I start to think about my self, one time I am happy that I am even

alive, and somedays I'm crying... No wait, I don't cry, because I totally forgot how to cry..

So...? Yeah... Just... I wan't to fucking die sometimes man... I really don't see any reason to

live, expect my parents of course... They are the only people on this world that keep me here...

Half-alive... Half-dead... Or is this just some of my mood swings that I even don't know about? Huh?

I HAVE NO IDEA... What if they actually like me, but I'm taking the smallest negative things close to

my hearth... And you know what?

I

DON'T

KNOW

For me... It is only blind end... When I'm spending time with others, in that time it seems like they

are only thinking about how could they spend that time with someone other than me... I lose the life.

THEY said to like myself, BUT I hate myself, how I'm supposed to love somebody that I hate the most

in my life... For the last time I've been searching somebody to throw guilt on... Only because I knew

that I wasn't the person who destroyed my life/childhood (Or was I?)...

I had a perfect childhood, like from my 0-4 years of life... then everything fucked up of course...

And how...? Oh... That's simple isn't it...? I lost completely of my hair and body hair, I was sick like

for 12 months in the year, I looked like an alien... Literally bald alien with 20kg... In 6 years of my

life...

Destroyed my psychicall health...

Then we moved from my hometown, to some crappy village where everybody was totally stupid...

I found new friends at the rowing club IN MY HOMETOWN...

Later... the club destroyed my mentallity

Completely broken ebortion waiting for death... Remained... Throwed like a feast for hounds... I don't know,

because it's not completely true... Parents loves me... More than anything else and I can't do anything to

myself, because I would harm them too... What a shitty... Ah... I even don't know how to call it...

Anyway I started new year/decade with the right move, didn't I?

Joking...

"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  

A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression

""Meaning can be obtained through pleasure

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

through accepting social responsibility, social roles

through believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

from waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations

If there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.

Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.

Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.

You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.

  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.

There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.

Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.

Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.

This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""

life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",not depression

"Birthday : Today's my birthday. Im 27 and already divorced. I sacrificed everything for a woman who abused the shit out of me. And I'd do it again. Because I'm stupid. I'm ""in love"" with my bartender because shes nice and occasionally buys me a drink. I have no friends, literally, they all sided with my ex. I have family but I'm a burdon to them. I'm high and drunk and, yeah I got myself a present this year. Same present I get myself every year. Just never found the courage to use it. Probably won't this year either, I'm a coward what can I say? Even my therapist told me I deserved some of the shit I've dealt with because I'm a guy and should always be up for people touching me.  Fuck. I'll see you tomorrow reddit, unless I don't. Piss off. Austin, maybe I'll see you tomorrow.

"Smart guy with a lot of dumb questions : I've really been struggling to post this, since I've always struggled to show any of my feelings towards everyone I know and even towards myself, but here we finally go.
I'm a 22 year-old medical student from Europe, 3.5 years into the studies, everything going well so far, passing all tests without even attending the lectures and starting to study few weeks prior to the test phase. Aside of that everything else has also always been going well for me, safe neighborhood, caring parents, good sportsman, nice friends.
But now it is that I just seem to have lost interest in everything I once loved over the past year or so. Maybe in life in general, since I don't see any sense in this life anymore. I know many people feel like this, but somehow they seem to find answers that keep them going. To me there is no answer to this question, that makes at least any sense. Some people want to be remembered, some want to achieve something for themselves, some don't want to think about these questions. I want absolutely nothing. Everything that I thought I wanted over the past few years only made me fun for a short time. Even when I have a good time going out with friends or so, that just vanishes, when I start to ask myself these questions and can't find an appropriate answer. 
So the best thing I've found to do since this started, is rapidly increase my weed consumption. I've been smoking for quite a few years, but it's gotten a little excessive the last year. I still mind to get my shit done, so I only start after I've finished what I had to do for the day. Then I roll a few fat ones and just try to make my  brain not think about those questions till I fall asleep. I've already thought about this causing all those problems in the first place, so I stopped smoking for 2.5 months last year and it didn't really affect my situation at all. I started again because I think it's just better to not think, than think of questions you can't find an answer to and that stop you from moving on.
That worked well for quite a time, but lately the quetions just keep getting more and more and I seem to find less and less answers. Why did I choose to study medicin in the first place? How could I think this would be fun for so long, even though it's just smashing facts in your brain, so that you can't possibly remember them?
But what hits me by far the most is this: Who the fuck am I even? I feel like what made me finish school without ever trying to ask these questions, is that my father would always have a talk with me when I got a C or worse. This didn't happen really often, but I remember feeling very bad after that for quite a time. I think that's why I still just keep going without even knowing why, I just couldn't stand disappointing him and my mother. So did I make this decision or was it the way society viewed me and I then thought I had to live up to? How can I go on without knowing this? How do I find the answers?
There's a lot more questions I struggle answering, but I don't wanna write too much, I doubt anyone's gonna make it until here anyway. If you read this and proved me wrong, thank you.",not depression

scared of hurting myself if i get drunk : so i turn 18 in a couple of days and it feels fucking weird saying that because when i was 13 i could not imagine my life past 16 or 17 and it’s very hard to wrap my head around that i’m actually here right now despite how much i wish i wasn’t. to celebrate my bday a small group of friends and i are having a party but i’m terrified to let myself get properly drunk. i’ve only drunk alcohol once or twice and have only gotten a bit tipsy for me that meant more friendly loud singing coming out of my shell. but that same night i only had 3ish drinks i found myself in my friends bathroom looking for something to sh with and just sitting on the floor spacing out. as much as i do want to die i don’t want to do in a way that’s harmful to my friends but i do wanna get drunk and force myself to have fun bc that’s what you’re supposed to do. but i just have this gut feeling that i will do something about ending my life if i drink a bunch bc the only thing now stopping me is just the courage and that’s literally the only thing alcohol gives me. i don’t really know what the point of posting this is it’s just a vent but maybe if anyone else has dealt w this,moderate
